The {{impulse}} is a concept that allows for the description and calculation of how forces affect the motion of objects over time, enabling the prediction and analysis of movement in [{{engineering}}] and [{{design}}} systems]. {{Impulse}} is defined as the [[integral]] of force with respect to time, representing the total effect of a force applied over a specific duration. This mathematical [[representation]] captures the cumulative impact of forces on an object's {{momentum}}, accounting for both the magnitude and the duration of the force. By analyzing the {{impulse}}, [{{engineers}}} and [{{designers}}}]] can understand and manipulate the motion of objects in their systems, facilitating the optimization of performance, safety, and efficiency.
