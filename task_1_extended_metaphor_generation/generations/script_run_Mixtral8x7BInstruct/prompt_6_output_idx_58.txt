"metaphor": "both Hubble's Law in big bang theory and Advanced Propulsion and Navigation System in Iron Man operate on the principle of proportionality, where the speed of an object is directly related to its distance",
"hubble's\_law": "Hubble's Law states that the speed at which a celestial object is moving away from us is directly proportional to its distance from us. This allows scientists to estimate the distance of a celestial object by measuring its redshift.",
"advanced\_propulsion\_and\_navigation\_system": "In Iron Man, the Advanced Propulsion and Navigation System uses a similar principle of proportionality, where the speed of the suit is directly related to the distance it travels. This allows Iron Man to accurately navigate through the air and space."
