Explanation:

* Central Bank: It is a single, centrally located institution that controls the monetary policy of a country, providing power and support for the surrounding economy.
* Interest Rates: They act as a gravitational force, influencing the behavior of borrowers and lenders, and maintaining the structural integrity and formation of the financial system.
* Seigniorage: It is the process of issuing and managing currency, releasing a large amount of seigniorage revenue that can then be harnessed and utilized for various purposes, such as funding government operations and stabilizing the economy.
* Monetary Policy Transmission: It is the transmission of monetary policy actions from the central bank to the rest of the economy, allowing for the illumination, warming, and shaping of conditions in the economic vicinity, just as energy from stars propagates outward and affects celestial bodies in their vicinity.
