      "mechanism": "The consistent composition of each nucleotide, with a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base, allows for predictable and reliable interaction between nucleotides in the creation of DNA."

      "description": "Scalability",
      "mechanism": "The ability to connect the phosphate group of one nucleotide to the sugar molecule of the next allows for the creation of a long chain, enabling the encoding of a large amount of genetic information in a single DNA molecule."

      "description": "Abstraction",
      "mechanism": "The specific sequence of nitrogenous bases in a DNA molecule encodes genetic information, abstracting the genetic instructions from the physical structure of the DNA molecule itself."
