"Advanced Nanotechnology Power Distribution" could be a feature in the domain of Iron Man that satisfies all the features of the spec.

Explanation:

* Efficient energy distribution and use: Just like the trophic system in an ecosystem, Iron Man's advanced nanotechnology power distribution system can convert and transfer energy efficiently, maximizing the potential for the suit's performance and functionality.
* Modular and self-organizing system: The power distribution system in Iron Man's suit can be seen as a modular and self-organizing system, where the addition or removal of components does not necessarily affect the functioning of the other components. This allows for a high degree of resilience and adaptability in the suit's power management.
* Geometric representation as a pyramid: The hierarchical structure of the power distribution system in Iron Man's suit can be visualized as a pyramid, with the energy source at the base and the various systems and components at the top. This pyramid shape represents the decreasing amount of energy and power available at each higher level.
