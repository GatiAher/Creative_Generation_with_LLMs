Error Handling is a {\{safety mechanism\}} that ensures the stability and reliability of a program by identifying and resolving any unexpected {\{conditions\}} or {\{inputs\}}, much like a {\[circuit breaker\]} in electrical engineering that protects circuits from damage caused by excess {\{current\}}. Error Handling involves the use of various techniques, such as {\{exception handling\}}, assertions, and validation checks, to detect and diagnose errors. Once an error is detected, the program can then decide on the appropriate course of action, such as logging the error, notifying the user, or gracefully terminating the program. This process is similar to the way a building's structural integrity is maintained through the use of {\[support beams\]}, which are designed to detect and distribute weight evenly, preventing the building from collapsing under excessive load.
