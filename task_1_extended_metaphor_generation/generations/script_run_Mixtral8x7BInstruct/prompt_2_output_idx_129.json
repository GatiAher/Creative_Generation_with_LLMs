  "purpose": "The Cinder Cone Volcano serves as a temporary containment and ejection structure for the volcanic materials, allowing for their gradual accumulation and formation into a distinct geographical feature.",
  "mechanism": "The Cinder Cone Volcano is built around a central vent, from which magma, cinders, and volcanic bombs are expelled. As these materials are ejected, they cool and solidify, creating a steep-sided cone shape. The accumulation of these materials around the vent creates a natural barrier, directing the ejected materials upwards and outwards, and allowing the volcano to grow in height and width. The structure is stabilized by the weight and friction of the accumulated materials, with the steep slopes created by the angular shape and loose packing of the cinders."
