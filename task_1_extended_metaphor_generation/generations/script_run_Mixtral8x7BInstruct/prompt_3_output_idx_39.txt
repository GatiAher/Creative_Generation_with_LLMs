""Transcription is the process of creating a {{blueprint (RNA molecule)}} from a master {{architectural plan (DNA molecule)}} to enable the construction of specific {{protein structures}} in a given spatial orientation. The {{DNA molecule}}, a double helix with a well-defined {{twisting pitch}} and {{diameter}}, serves as the template for RNA synthesis. A specialized {{engineering tool, the RNA polymerase}}, moves along the DNA template, unzipping the double helix and mathematically translating the {{geometric pattern}} of nucleotide bases into a complementary RNA sequence. This process involves a series of precise {{geometrical movements}} and {{calculations}}, ensuring the accurate conversion of genetic information from DNA to RNA."""
