"Fandom Engagement"

Explanation:

* Feedback Mechanism: Kpop fandoms provide feedback through various means such as social media, online polls, and streaming statistics, which are used by Kpop agencies to adjust their strategies and marketing efforts.
* Specialized Cells: Kpop groups have specialized members, each with their own role and expertise, who come together to create a cohesive and successful group.
* Hormonal Regulation: While not a direct analogy, the concept of "chemistry" in Kpop can be compared to hormonal regulation, as the successful blending of individual talents and personalities creates a harmonious and appealing final product.
* Precise Regulation: Kpop agencies carefully regulate and manage every aspect of their groups, from training to marketing, to ensure the success and longevity of their careers. This precise regulation is essential for maintaining the optimal functioning of the Kpop industry and meeting the expectations of fans.
