"Fractal Network of Digital Currencies"

This feature satisfies the spec as follows:

* "Efficient distribution and utilization" is satisfied through the modeling of the flow of resources (money) within a system, similar to a distribution network in engineering or logistics. A fractal network can adapt and self-organize to optimize the distribution of money, making it more efficient.
* "Redundancy" is satisfied through the complex geometric structure of the network, which allows for multiple pathways for money to flow. This increases the overall resilience and stability of the financial system.
* "Analysis and prediction" is satisfied through the geometric structure that enables the analysis of its structure and properties using mathematical tools. This allows for understanding and prediction of the system's behavior under various conditions, enabling better financial decision making.

Note: The feature is hypothetical and not currently implemented, but it represents a concept that could potentially be developed and used in the future.
