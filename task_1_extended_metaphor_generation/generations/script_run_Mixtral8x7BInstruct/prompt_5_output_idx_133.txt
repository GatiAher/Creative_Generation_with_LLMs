"Rotational efficiency of baseball pitching motion"

This feature in baseball satisfies the spec because:

* Compact, stable, and efficient: A well-coordinated pitching motion is compact and stable, reducing the risk of injury and increasing the efficiency of the throw.
* Geometrically optimized design: The pitching motion involves a series of geometrically optimized movements, such as the wind-up, stride, and follow-through, which allow for maximum power and control.
* Hydrogen bonds: While not directly related to hydrogen bonds, the pitching motion relies on the transfer of energy from the larger muscles to the smaller muscles, similar to how hydrogen bonds facilitate the transfer of energy between complementary base pairs in DNA.
* Helical shape: The pitching motion involves a helical shape, as the pitcher's body rotates and twists to generate power and control, similar to the helical shape of the double helix structure in DNA.
