  "purpose": "The Formal Charge helps in evenly distributing the electrons in a molecule, ensuring a balanced electrical charge and providing insight into the molecule's behavior and properties.",
  "mechanism": "The Formal Charge is calculated using a mathematical formula based on the atom's valence electrons and its assigned electrons in the Lewis structure. By comparing the formal charge of neighboring atoms, one can identify areas of charge concentration and evaluate the molecule's stability and electron distribution."
