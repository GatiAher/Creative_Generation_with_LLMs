  "purpose": "The purpose of Covalent Bonding is to create molecular compounds by enabling atom stability through shared electron pairs, resulting in the formation of various geometric shapes that enhance molecular compound integrity and functionality.",
  "mechanism": "In Covalent Bonding, atoms share electrons to reach a stable electron configuration, often following the Octet Rule which states that atoms tend to have eight electrons in their outermost energy level. This sharing results in the formation of a electron cloud between the nuclei of the atoms involved, creating a force that holds them together. The geometry of covalent bonding is determined by the number of electron pairs around the atom, leading to different shapes such as linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, and octahedral. These shapes provide structural integrity and influence the compound's properties and behavior, making Covalent Bonding essential for the design and engineering of molecular compounds."
