* Digestion and Absorption: Financial infrastructure has structures for digesting and absorbing financial information, such as data processing systems and financial databases, to enable informed decision-making and risk management.
* Optimization of Hunting and Foraging Strategies: Financial infrastructure uses geometry and mathematical relationships to optimize financial strategies, such as portfolio diversification, asset allocation, and risk management.
* Efficiency: Financial infrastructure is designed to ensure that financial transactions can be processed efficiently, reducing costs, and increasing accessibility.
