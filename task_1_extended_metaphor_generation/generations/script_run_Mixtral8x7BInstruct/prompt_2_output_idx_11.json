  "purpose": "The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation serves as a 'fossil record' of the Big Bang, providing evidence for the theory and insights into the universe's origins. It also offers a baseline for measuring the uniformity of the universe, as any deviations from this uniformity could suggest the presence of previously undetected matter or energy.",
  "mechanism": "The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is a form of electromagnetic radiation, similar to light or radio waves, but with longer wavelengths. It is the cooled remnant of the intense heat generated during the Big Bang. As the universe expanded and cooled, this radiation filled the entire universe, maintaining a uniform temperature due to the high degree of symmetry in the early universe. Small variations in temperature and density, imprinted on this radiation, provide a snapshot of the universe approximately 380,000 years after the Big Bang, when it had cooled enough for electrons and protons to combine and form neutral hydrogen atoms. These variations can be analyzed using mathematical tools, such as Fourier analysis, and engineering techniques, such as multi-frequency measurements and map-making algorithms, to extract valuable information about the universe's geometry, composition, and evolution."
