Decentralized banking system

Explanation:

* Specialization of cells for hormone production: This is similar to the central bank's role in a decentralized banking system. The central bank is responsible for managing the money supply, setting interest rates, and maintaining financial stability.
* Optimization of environmental conditions: A decentralized banking system allows for efficient and targeted allocation of financial resources, as decisions are made locally and based on the specific needs of the community.
* Redundancy and backup systems: Decentralized banking systems often have multiple financial institutions, allowing for a backup system in case of failure or damage to one institution.
* Homeostasis and regulation: A decentralized banking system helps maintain financial stability by allowing for a diversity of financial institutions and practices, which can help prevent the build-up of systemic risks.
* Modularity and compartmentalization: Decentralized banking systems are composed of many independent financial institutions, allowing for the separation of functions and ensuring that any issues in one institution do not affect the entire system.
