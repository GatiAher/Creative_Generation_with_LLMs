  "purpose": "The Relief on a topographic map serves to represent the variation in height or elevation across a geographical area, enabling the user to understand the terrain's three-dimensional nature. This information is crucial for activities such as hiking, construction, urban planning, and environmental studies.",
  "mechanism": "Relief on a topographic map is achieved through the use of contour lines, which connect points of equal elevation. The distance between these lines indicates the rate of change in elevation. Additionally, shading, hypsometric tints, or exaggerated vertical relief may be employed to enhance the visual representation of height differences. These mechanisms work together to convey a sense of the terrain's undulations, inclines, and depressions, providing a valuable tool for interpreting and analyzing geographical features."
