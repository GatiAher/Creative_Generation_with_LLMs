"Artificial black hole technology" could potentially satisfy the features of the spec in the context of Iron Man. This technology could involve the use of advanced machinery built into Iron Man's suit to manipulate spacetime and create a localized region of intense gravitational force. The curvature of spacetime within this region could be used to determine gravitational force, while the differential force caused by the extreme gravitational gradient could lead to stretching and deformation of objects within the vicinity. However, it's important to note that this is a highly speculative concept and not something that currently exists within the Marvel Universe or in real life.
