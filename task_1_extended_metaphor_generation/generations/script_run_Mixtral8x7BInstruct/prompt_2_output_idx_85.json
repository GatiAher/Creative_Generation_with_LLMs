  "purpose": "Computer Networks serve as a conduit for facilitating communication and resource sharing among distributed devices, in an analogous manner to how geometric lines and shapes enable the connection and interaction of points in space.",
  "mechanism": "These networks operate on the principles of mathematical graph theory, where nodes (computers) are interconnected by edges (links) to form a topological structure. This structure supports the purpose by enabling data transmission and resource allocation through various engineering techniques such as packet switching, routing algorithms, and flow control mechanisms. Additionally, network design considerations such as scalability, reliability, and security are essential for ensuring seamless and efficient communication between network nodes."
