  "purpose": "Isotope dating is a method to estimate the elapsed time since the occurrence of certain geological events, by measuring the ratio of specific radioactive isotopes to their decay products, thereby providing a quantifiable value for temporal analysis.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of isotope dating is rooted in the principles of nuclear decay, where unstable atomic isotopes emit subatomic particles to achieve a stable state over time. This decay rate is constant and can be expressed mathematically as a half-life, which is the time required for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. By comparing the ratio of remaining radioactive isotopes to their decay products, engineers and scientists can calculate the elapsed time since the formation of a rock or mineral, utilizing geometric relationships to understand spatial distribution and isotopic concentrations."
