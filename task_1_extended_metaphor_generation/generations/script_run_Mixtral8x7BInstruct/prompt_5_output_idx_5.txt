"The movement and interaction of baseballs, bats, players, and fields" could potentially satisfy all the features of the spec. Here's how:

* Diverse range of environments for potential life support: The movement and interaction of baseballs, bats, players, and fields can create a diverse range of environments for potential plays, strategies, and outcomes.
* Study of celestial phenomena: While not exactly "celestial," the movement of the baseball follows the laws of physics, including projectile motion, air resistance, and spin, which can be studied and analyzed to understand the game better.
* Dynamic stability and structure: The movement and interaction of baseballs, bats, players, and fields create a dynamic and constantly changing environment, with each action and reaction contributing to the overall stability and structure of the game.
