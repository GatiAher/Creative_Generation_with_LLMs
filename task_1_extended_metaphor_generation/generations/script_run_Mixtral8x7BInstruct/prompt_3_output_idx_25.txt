Consumers serve as the "{{energy converters}}" within {{ecosystems}}, transforming the {{energy}} and {{nutrients}} stored in their prey into forms that support the survival and growth of other organisms. Consumers are {{designed}} with specialized {{structures}} and {{functions}} that enable them to locate, capture, and process prey. This includes {{sensory systems}} to detect prey, physical structures for capturing and consuming prey (e.g. {{teeth}}, {{claws}}, {{beaks}}), and {{biochemical processes}} for digesting and absorbing nutrients. The [[geometry]] of their bodies and the [[mathematical relationships]] between their structures (e.g. [[lever arms]], [[muscle ratios]]) enable them to optimize their hunting and foraging strategies, while the [[engineering principles]] of efficiency and durability ensure that their systems can withstand the demands of capturing and consuming prey.
