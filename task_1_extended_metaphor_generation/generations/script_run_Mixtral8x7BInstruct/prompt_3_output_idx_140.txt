The {{Lithosphere}} serves as the stable foundation and the mechanically robust outer layer of the Earth, enabling the formation of diverse landscapes and providing a solid base for the biosphere. The {{Lithosphere}} is structurally composed of several tectonic plates, which are {{geometrically}} defined as rigid, irregularly shaped shells that float and move relative to one another on the underlying semi-fluid Asthenosphere. These plates are subjected to forces arising from convective {{mantle currents}}, leading to their motion and interaction, including sliding past each other, colliding, or separating. These interactions result in geological phenomena such as earthquakes, volcanic activity, and the creation or destruction of crustal landforms, contributing to the constant yet evolving nature of the Earth's surface.
