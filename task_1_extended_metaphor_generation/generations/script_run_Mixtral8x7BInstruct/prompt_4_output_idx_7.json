      "description": "Friction-based propulsion",
      "mechanism": "Friction generated between a meteoroid and atmospheric gases causes the meteoroid to heat up and vaporize, producing a bright streak of light and propelling the meteoroid towards the planet's surface."

      "description": "Size and speed-dependent brightness",
      "mechanism": "The size of the meteoroid and its speed determine the brightness and duration of the meteor, allowing for a visible indication of the meteoroid's size and speed."
