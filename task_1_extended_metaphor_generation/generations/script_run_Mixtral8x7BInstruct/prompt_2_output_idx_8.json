  "purpose": "Meteorites serve as natural time capsules, providing valuable information about the formation and evolution of our solar system. They offer insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of celestial bodies, enabling scientists to study the building blocks of planets and moons.",
  "mechanism": "Meteorites are small, asteroid-like bodies that originate from various sources within the solar system. Their journey to Earth begins as meteoroids, which are then captured by Earth's gravitational field and become meteors as they enter the atmosphere. The friction generated by their high-speed passage through the atmosphere causes them to heat up and glow, creating the spectacular meteor showers often observed at night. Once they cool down, the surviving meteoroids that reach the ground are called meteorites. The information they contain is unlocked through various mathematical, engineering, and design techniques, such as isotopic analysis, spectroscopy, and microscopy, allowing scientists to study their composition, history, and impact on Earth's geology and climate."
