  "purpose": "The Transform Boundary serves as a precise mechanism for the management of stress and strain built up from the relative lateral motion of two adjacent tectonic plates, preventing catastrophic earthquakes by facilitating smaller, more frequent adjustments.",
  "mechanism": "Composed of fault lines, the Transform Boundary operates on the principles of geometry, math, engineering, and design to allow for lateral slippage between the plates. The boundary's structure, characterized by a series of interconnected fault lines, creates a zigzag pattern that effectively accommodates the relative motion of the adjacent plates. This mechanism dissipates energy and reduces the likelihood of large-scale, destructive seismic events."
