"Umpire's Called Strikes"

Explanation:

* Feedback Mechanism: The umpire's call of strikes provides feedback to the batter and pitcher about the outcome of each pitch, allowing them to adjust their future actions accordingly.
* Specialized Cells: The umpire's eyes and brain are the specialized cells in this case, as they work together to make the call of whether a pitch is a strike or not.
* Hormonal Regulation: While not directly related to hormones, the umpire's call of strikes regulates the pace and flow of the game, much like how hormones regulate various physiological processes.
* Precise Regulation: The umpire's call of strikes must be precise to ensure fairness and maintain the integrity of the game. The umpire must accurately judge the location of the pitch in relation to the strike zone, which is a precise area above home plate.
