"Ledger-based blockchain technology"

Explanation:

* Compact, stable, and efficient: Blockchain technology, particularly in the form of a ledger, provides a compact and efficient way to record and verify transactions. It is also stable and secure due to its decentralized nature and consensus mechanisms.
* Geometrically optimized design: While not a physical structure, blockchain technology is geometrically optimized in the sense that it allows for the efficient and scalable addition of new blocks to the chain, while maintaining the integrity and security of the existing data.
* Hydrogen bonds: Although not applicable in a literal sense, the concept of "bonds" is still relevant in blockchain technology. The cryptographic algorithms used to secure the blockchain, such as hash functions, create bonds between blocks that ensure the integrity and security of the data.
* Helical shape: While not a physical structure, the sequential and interconnected nature of blocks in a blockchain can be thought of as having a "helical" shape, as each block builds upon the previous one in a linear and continuous manner. This ensures the robustness, scalability, and fault-tolerance of the system.
