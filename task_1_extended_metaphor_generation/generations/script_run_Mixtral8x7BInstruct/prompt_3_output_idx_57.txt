The Collision Theory provides a {geometric and energetic framework} to explain the conditions necessary for {{chemical reactions}} to occur, enabling {{engineers and designers}} to predict and optimize reaction outcomes using {mathematical models and physical configurations}. According to the Collision Theory, {{reactant molecules}} must {geometrically collide} with sufficient {kinetic energy} ({{translational, rotational, or vibrational}}) to overcome activation barriers, forming {{transient intermediate states}} that can further rearrange into products. This theory incorporates {mathematical concepts} such as activation energy, reaction cross section, and rate constants, and can be visualized using {spatial arrangements} and collision frequency calculations, providing a foundation for reaction engineering and design.
