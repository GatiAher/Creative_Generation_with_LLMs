  "purpose": "The purpose of Momentum Transfer is to describe how the motion of an object is affected when it collides or interacts with another object. It helps us understand and predict the resulting motion and behavior of both objects.",
  "mechanism": "Momentum Transfer is based on the principle of conservation of momentum, which states that the total momentum of a closed system remains constant before and after an interaction. This is because the momentum lost by one object is gained by the other. The mechanism of momentum transfer can be explained using mathematical equations, such as the impulse-momentum theorem, and geometrical representations, such as vector diagrams, to illustrate the direction and magnitude of momentum transfer in different scenarios. The concept is applied in various engineering and design fields, such as vehicle crash safety, sports equipment design, and fluid dynamics, to optimize performance and safety."
