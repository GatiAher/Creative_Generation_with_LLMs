  "purpose": "Isotope fractionation serves as a tool to analyze and understand the behavior and properties of different isotopes of an element, based on their mass and energy differences, without relying on geology-specific terms.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of isotope fractionation is rooted in the principles of geometry, math, engineering, and design. It is based on the concept that isotopes with different masses have slightly different physical and chemical properties. This leads to unequal distribution of isotopes in a system during processes such as diffusion, reaction, or phase change. The degree of fractionation can be quantified using mathematical equations and ratios. By analyzing the isotopic composition of a substance, engineers and scientists can gain insights into the conditions and processes it has undergone, making isotope fractionation a powerful tool for investigation and analysis."
