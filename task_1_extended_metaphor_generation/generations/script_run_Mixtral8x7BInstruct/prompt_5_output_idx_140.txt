"Iconic Choreographies"

Explanation:

* Modularity: Iconic Kpop choreographies are often broken down into fundamental units or steps, which can be easily learned, taught, and modified for different performances or versions of the song.
* Standardized Interfaces: Just like the specific bonding pairs between Nitrogenous Bases, iconic Kpop choreographies have standardized moves and formations that ensure consistency in performances, making it easy for fans to recognize and follow along.
* Redundancy: The repetition of certain moves and formations in Kpop choreographies helps to stabilize the overall performance and allows for faithful duplication during practice and rehearsals.
* Scalability: Iconic Kpop choreographies can be adapted and scaled to fit different stage sizes, group formations, and audience interactions, allowing for the creation of new performances and the growth of the group's popularity.
* Modifiability: Kpop choreographies can be modified and updated over time to reflect changes in the group's style, music, or member lineup, enabling the creation of new and unique performances while still retaining the iconic status of the original choreography.
