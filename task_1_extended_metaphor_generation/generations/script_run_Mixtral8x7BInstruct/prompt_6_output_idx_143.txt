In this metaphor, Nitrogenous Bases in DNA are compared to fundamental units of information in Ledger-based digital currency systems. Both have modularity, standardized interfaces, redundancy, scalability, and modifiability, which enable precise replication, reliable interactions, stability, growth, and evolution, respectively. By highlighting these similarities, the metaphor emphasizes the role of information and communication in both biological and financial systems, and the importance of fundamental design principles in enabling complex and dynamic behaviors.
