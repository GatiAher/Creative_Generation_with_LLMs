  "purpose": "Deoxyribose is the structural backbone of the DNA molecule, providing a stable and durable framework that allows the DNA to maintain its structure and integrity within the cell. Its geometry and design enable the DNA molecule to store and transmit genetic information accurately and efficiently.",
  "mechanism": "Deoxyribose is a five-carbon sugar with a unique design that includes the absence of one oxygen atom (deoxyribose vs ribose in RNA). This gives it a more stable and compact structure, allowing the DNA molecule to pack tightly into the cell. The sugar molecules are linked together by phosphate groups, forming a double helix structure with the bases (adenine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine) in the center. This design enables the DNA to store genetic information in the form of base pair sequences and to transmit this information accurately during replication and transcription."
