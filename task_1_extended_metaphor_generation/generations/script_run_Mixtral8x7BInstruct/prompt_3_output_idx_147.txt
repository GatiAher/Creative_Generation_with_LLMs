"Isotope dating" is a method to estimate the elapsed time since the occurrence of certain geological events, by measuring the "ratio" of specific "radioactive isotopes" to their decay products, thereby providing a quantifiable value for temporal analysis. The mechanism of isotope dating is rooted in the principles of "nuclear decay", where unstable atomic "isotopes" emit subatomic particles to achieve a stable state over time. This decay rate is constant and can be expressed "mathematically" as a "half-life", which is the time required for half of the radioactive isotopes to decay. By comparing the "ratio" of remaining radioactive isotopes to their decay products, "[engineers](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/engineer)" and "[scientists](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scientist)" can calculate the elapsed time since the formation of a rock or mineral, utilizing "[geometric](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/geometric)" relationships to understand "[spatial](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/spatial)" distribution and isotopic concentrations.
