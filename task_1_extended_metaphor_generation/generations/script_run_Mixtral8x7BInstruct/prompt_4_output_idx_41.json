      "description": "Modular Design",
      "mechanism": "The pituitary gland is divided into two parts, the anterior and posterior pituitary, each with a unique set of hormones and functions, working together to maintain the body's equilibrium and growth."

      "description": "Feedback Control",
      "mechanism": "The hypothalamus receives information from the body and uses this information to produce releasing hormones that stimulate or inhibit the pituitary gland to release its own hormones, creating a feedback control system."

      "description": "Efficient Communication",
      "mechanism": "Hormones are transported through the bloodstream to target glands and organs, allowing for efficient communication and coordination between different parts of the body."
