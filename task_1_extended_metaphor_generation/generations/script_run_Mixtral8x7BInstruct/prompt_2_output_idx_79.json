  "purpose": "Control Structures serve as the 'blueprint' for the logical progression of a program, similar to how a geometric shape has a specific layout and form that defines its existence and properties. Just as in geometry where certain rules and principles govern the construction and manipulation of shapes, Control Structures employ mathematical and logical concepts such as conditions and loops to dictate the flow and execution of instructions within a program.",
  "mechanism": "Control Structures can be broadly categorized into two types: conditionals and loops. Conditionals act as a 'filter' or 'decision-making' mechanism, similar to how an engineering design must adhere to specific constraints and conditions in order to function properly. For example, an 'if-else' statement can be thought of as a design requirement that must be met before proceeding to the next step. Loops, on the other hand, provide a way to repeatedly execute a set of instructions, much like a manufacturing process where the same operation is performed multiple times in order to produce a desired outcome. Both conditionals and loops are fundamental building blocks in programming, providing the necessary structure and organization for creating complex and dynamic systems."
