"DNA-like Choreography" - It is a compact, stable, and efficient dance formation used by Kpop groups, which resembles the double helix structure of DNA. The geometrically optimized design of the formation allows for efficient packaging of the group on stage, while the synchronization of the dancers' movements through hydrogen bond-like connections creates precise pairing and sequencing of moves, providing a mathematical framework for the choreography. The dynamic and flowing nature of the formation facilitates the transport and manipulation of the group on stage, and ensures robustness, scalability, and fault-tolerance in the performance.
