The {{reactants}} serve as the starting materials or 'inputs' to a {{chemical reaction}}, which, when combined and manipulated under specific conditions, will transform into different substances, known as 'products'. {{Reactants}} can be thought of as the fundamental building blocks of a {{chemical reaction}}, akin to raw materials in a manufacturing process. They possess unique properties and characteristics, such as [[molecular geometry]] and {{chemical composition}}, that determine their behavior and interaction with other substances. In [[mathematical terms]], the {{reactants}} can be represented as variables in a {{chemical equation}}, with the coefficients of these variables indicating the {{stoichiometric relationships}} between the reactants. The [[engineering]] and [[design aspects]] of reactants involve understanding the properties and behaviors of these substances, as well as how they can be combined and manipulated to achieve desired outcomes. This requires a deep understanding of the underlying [[geometric]] and [[mathematical principles]] that govern {{chemical reactions}}, as well as the ability to design experiments and analyze data to optimize reaction conditions and improve reaction efficiency.
