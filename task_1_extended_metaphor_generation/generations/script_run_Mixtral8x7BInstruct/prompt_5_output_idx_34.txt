"Repulsor Tech Cooling System" - This feature in Iron Man's suit uses gravitational fields to manipulate and redirect external threats (like meteoroids) towards the suit's cooling system. The friction generated between the redirected objects and the suit's cooling system generates heat, which is then used to maintain the suit's temperature. The cooling system also ensures the survival of any captured objects, allowing for scientific analysis using various mathematical and scientific techniques.
