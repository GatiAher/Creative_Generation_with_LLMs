"Data replication" is a strategy that aims to enhance "data" {{reliability, availability, and performance}} in {{distributed computing systems}} by creating and maintaining multiple copies of data across various locations. By doing so, it ensures that even if one copy becomes unavailable due to failures or network partitions, the system can still access and utilize other copies, thereby minimizing downtime and maintaining functionality.

In the context of [[geometry]], data replication can be thought of as creating multiple congruent shapes (data copies) distributed across a space (distributed system). Each shape retains the same properties and attributes as the original, ensuring {{consistency}}.

In terms of {{math}}, it's akin to having multiple equations representing the same function, allowing the system to solve for a value (data access) using any of the available equations.

From an engineering perspective, data replication is like building {{redundant components}} in a system, ensuring that even if one fails, others can take over, providing {{fault tolerance}}.

Design-wise, it's akin to creating multiple backups of a blueprint, ensuring that any changes or modifications are consistently applied across all copies, and enabling access to a copy even if the original is lost or corrupted.
