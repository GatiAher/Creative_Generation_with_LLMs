{
  "purpose": "The translation process serves as a blueprint-to-product assembly line, converting the information-rich genetic code into a physical protein product through a series of precise steps and calculations, much like a manufacturing process in engineering.",
  "mechanism": "The genetic code, represented as a sequence of nucleotides in RNA, undergoes a systematic mapping process to assign specific amino acids. This mapping process involves a 'reader' (Ribosome) and 'instructional guides' (tRNA molecules), which interact in a coordinated and geometrically-constrained manner to facilitate the addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain. The process adheres to a strict 'start-stop' mechanism, similar to a programming language, to ensure accurate and controlled protein synthesis."
