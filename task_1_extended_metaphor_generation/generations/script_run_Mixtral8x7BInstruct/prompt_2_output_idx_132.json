  "purpose": "Tephra serves as a natural disaster management system by providing a protective layer and reducing soil erosion, contributing to the formation of new fertile soil that supports vegetation growth.",
  "mechanism": "Tephra is composed of angular, irregularly shaped pyroclastic fragments with varying sizes, from volcanic bombs to fine ash. The geometry of these fragments interlocks and interlocks, creating a porous and permeable structure that can absorb and retain water. This porosity also allows for the insulation of underlying surfaces from extreme temperatures, providing a protective barrier. The math of tephra's structure is characterized by its grain size distribution, which follows a log-normal pattern. The engineering and design aspects of tephra involve the understanding of its mechanical properties, such as shear strength, permeability, and angle of repose, which determine its ability to support structures and resist erosion."
