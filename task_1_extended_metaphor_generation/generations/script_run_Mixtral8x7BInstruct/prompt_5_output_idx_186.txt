"Iron Man's Arc Reactor"

Explanation:

* Geometric Precision: The Arc Reactor's design and construction showcase a high degree of geometric precision, allowing it to generate a stable and consistent energy source for Iron Man's suit.
* Sensitivity to Light: The Arc Reactor's core can be designed to be sensitive to external light sources, which could trigger or enhance its energy output, similar to how the pineal gland responds to light.
* Efficient Communication: The Arc Reactor's precise design ensures efficient communication with other systems in Iron Man's suit, allowing for seamless integration and coordination of various functions.
* Hormone Secretion and Transportation (modified for Iron Man): The Arc Reactor distributes energy throughout Iron Man's suit, similar to how the pineal gland secretes and transports hormones. This energy distribution enables the suit's various systems to function optimally, paralleling the role of hormones in maintaining the body's balance.
