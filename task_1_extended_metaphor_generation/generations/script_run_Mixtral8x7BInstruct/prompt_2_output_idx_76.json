  "purpose": "The Algorithm is a set of instructions designed to solve a particular problem or perform a specific task in an efficient and reliable manner. It is akin to a mathematical formula or an engineering blueprint, providing a clear and concise roadmap to the desired outcome.",
  "mechanism": "The Algorithm's mechanism is based on a series of well-defined steps, each building upon the previous one. This step-by-step approach is similar to a geometric proof or a design process, where each step is justified and necessary to reach the final solution. The Algorithm takes inputs, processes them through a series of mathematical and logical operations, and produces outputs that are correct and consistent with the problem at hand."
