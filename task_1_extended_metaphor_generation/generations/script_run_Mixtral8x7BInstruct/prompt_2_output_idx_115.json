  "purpose": "To provide a visual shorthand that aids in the efficient communication of geographical information, enabling users to interpret and understand the layout of various features in a topographic map without needing to label every single element",
  "mechanism": "Through the use of standardized, easily recognizable icons and markings, symbols in topographic maps represent different types of geographical features, such as buildings, roads, water bodies, and vegetation. These symbols are often mathematically and geometrically precise, utilizing specific shapes, sizes, orientations, and patterns to denote the relative position, scale, and importance of the represented features. The consistent application of these symbols adheres to engineering and design principles, ensuring that the map is both accurate and readable, thereby facilitating intuitive comprehension and analysis of the geographical data."
