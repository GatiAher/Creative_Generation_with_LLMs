"Meteors (or {\{Shooting Stars\}}) serve as a natural method for transporting and depositing {\{extraterrestrial material\}} onto the Earth's surface, contributing to the planet's geological and biological evolution. Meteors are created when small, solid bodies called {\{meteoroids\}} enter the Earth's atmosphere at high speeds, typically ranging from 11 to 72 {\{kilometers per second\}}. The friction generated between the {\\{meteoroid\}} and the atmospheric gases causes the {\{meteoroid\}} to heat up and vaporize, producing the bright streak of light known as a {\{meteor\}} or shooting star. The size of the {\{meteoroid\}} and its speed determine the brightness and duration of the meteor. Most {\\{meteoroids\}} disintegrate completely before reaching the Earth's surface, but larger ones may survive and strike the ground as {\{meteorites\}}, delivering {\\{extraterrestrial material\}}} to the planet."
