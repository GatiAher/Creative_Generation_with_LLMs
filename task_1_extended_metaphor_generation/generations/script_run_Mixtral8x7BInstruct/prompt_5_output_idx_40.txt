"Dedicated Fanbase"

Explanation:

* Absorption and Sacrifice: Kpop fans, often referred to as "fanbases," are known for their unwavering support and protection of their favorite idols. They absorb any negative comments or threats and sacrifice their own interests to ensure the well-being and success of the group.
* Spherical Formation: The global distribution of Kpop fanbases creates a "spherical formation" of protection around the idols. No matter where threats originate, the fanbase can dissipate and deflect them before they reach the idols.
* Gravitational Force: The passion and influence of the fanbase exert a strong "gravitational force" that attracts new fans and keeps existing ones loyal. This force also enables the fanbase to capture the attention of a wider audience, further promoting the success of the Kpop group.
