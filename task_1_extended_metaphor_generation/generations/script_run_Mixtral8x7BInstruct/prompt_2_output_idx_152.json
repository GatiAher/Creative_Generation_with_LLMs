  "purpose": "Thermal energy, also known as heat energy, is a form of energy that is transferred between two substances at different temperatures. It plays a crucial role in many engineering and design applications by serving as a measure of a system's capacity to do work, providing a means to transfer energy from one place to another, and enabling the conversion of energy from one form to another. In the context of geometry, thermal energy can be thought of as a measure of the disorder or randomness of particles in a system, with higher temperatures corresponding to greater disorder.",
  "mechanism": "Thermal energy is a measure of the kinetic energy of the particles in a substance, with kinetic energy being defined as the energy of motion. In a solid, the particles are arranged in a regular lattice structure and vibrate in place. As the temperature of the solid increases, the particles vibrate with greater amplitude, absorbing more energy in the process. In a liquid or gas, the particles are free to move and collide with one another, with the average kinetic energy of the particles increasing with temperature. The transfer of thermal energy between substances occurs through the collision of particles, with energy being transferred from areas of high temperature to areas of low temperature. This process can be described mathematically using the principles of statistical mechanics, which provide a framework for understanding the behavior of large collections of particles."
