"metaphor": "both Redshift in big bang theory and Inflation Adjustment of Money Supply in money have the use of observation and measurement to understand and quantify their respective domains (string)",
"redshift": "Redshift in big bang theory uses observation and measurement of the wavelength of light from distant galaxies, which appears to stretch as it moves away from an observer in an expanding universe, shifting it towards longer, redder wavelengths. This observation and measurement provide valuable insights into the history and evolution of the universe and allow scientists to estimate the time elapsed since the Big Bang (string)",
"inflation\_adjustment\_of\_money\_supply": "Inflation Adjustment of Money Supply in money also uses observation and measurement, in this case of economic indicators such as the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI), to understand and quantify the money supply and its impact on the economy. Adjusting the money supply based on these observations and measurements allows for the mitigation of economic volatility and inflation (string)"

"redshift": "Redshift in big bang theory uses the principle of the redshift effect, where the wavelength of light appears to stretch as it moves away from an observer in an expanding universe, shifting it towards longer, redder wavelengths. This allows scientists to determine the distance and speed of distant galaxies, providing valuable insights into the history and evolution of the universe (string)",
"inflation\_adjustment\_of\_money\_supply": "Inflation Adjustment of Money Supply in money uses the principle of the impact of inflation on the measurement of money supply. Adjusting the money supply based on the rate of inflation allows for the mitigation of economic volatility and inflation. This is similar to how the redshift effect is used to determine the distance and speed of distant galaxies (string)"

"metaphor": "both Redshift in big bang theory and Inflation Adjustment of Money Supply in money have the use of geometric and physical concepts to explain their respective principles (string)",
"redshift": "Redshift in big bang theory uses concepts from geometry and physics, such as the Doppler effect, to explain the redshift effect and the universe's expansion. This allows scientists to understand and quantify the universe's expansion and estimate the time elapsed since the Big Bang (string)",
"inflation\_adjustment\_of\_money\_supply": "Inflation Adjustment of Money Supply in money uses concepts from economics and finance, such as the Quantity Theory of Money, to explain the impact of inflation on the money supply. This allows policymakers to understand and quantify the money supply and its impact on the economy, and make adjustments as necessary to mitigate economic volatility and inflation (string)"
