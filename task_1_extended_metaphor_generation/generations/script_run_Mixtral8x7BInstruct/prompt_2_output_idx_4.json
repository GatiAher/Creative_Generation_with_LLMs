  "purpose": "Asteroids represent leftover materials from the formation of the solar system, providing valuable insights into its history and composition. They also pose a potential hazard to Earth, making their study crucial for planetary defense.",
  "mechanism": "Asteroids are irregularly shaped celestial bodies, composed mainly of rock and metal. They orbit the Sun in elliptical paths, primarily in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter. Their orbits can be influenced by the gravitational forces of the planets, leading to possible collisions with Earth or other celestial bodies. Studying their geometry, orbital mechanics, and material properties helps us understand the formation of the solar system, the risks they pose, and potential resources they may contain."
