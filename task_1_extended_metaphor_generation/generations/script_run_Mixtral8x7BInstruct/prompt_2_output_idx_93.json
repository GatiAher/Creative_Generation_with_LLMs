  "purpose": "Clustering aims to create a unified and efficient system by combining multiple distributed systems, enhancing performance, and ensuring high availability through load balancing and fault tolerance.",
  "mechanism": "In the realm of geometry, clustering can be thought of as arranging multiple points (distributed systems) in a way that optimizes their overall performance and reduces the risk of failure. This is achieved by creating a geometrically balanced structure where each point shares the workload with its neighbors, ensuring that no single point is overwhelmed. In terms of math, clustering involves the use of algorithms to determine the optimal arrangement and balance of points in the system. Engineering principles are applied to design a robust and scalable architecture that can handle the increased workload and provide seamless failover capabilities. The design ensures that each point in the cluster can take over for another point if it fails, ensuring high availability."
