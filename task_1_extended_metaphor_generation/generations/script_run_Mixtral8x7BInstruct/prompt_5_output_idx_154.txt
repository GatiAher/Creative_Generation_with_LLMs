Redundant and Modular Arc Reactor. This power source, as depicted in the Iron Man comics and movies, is a compact, self-sustaining fusion reactor that provides power to Iron Man's suit. It has redundancy through its multiple layers of containment and cooling systems, ensuring continuous operation even in case of damage. Its design is modular, allowing for easy replacement and repair of components. The standardization of components and processes ensures compatibility and reliability. The reactor's automation, through AI and robotics, ensures efficient operation and minimizes human error. Lastly, the reactor's fault tolerance is achieved through its design, which incorporates multiple safety measures to prevent catastrophic failures.
