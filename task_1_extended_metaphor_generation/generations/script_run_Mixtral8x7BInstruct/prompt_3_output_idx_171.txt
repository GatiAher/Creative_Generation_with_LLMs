""{{Physical particles}} and {{forces}} in the universe are understood and organized using {{branes}}, which generalize the concept of a {{point particle}} to higher dimensions. Branes offer a more {{complex}} and {{nuanced model of reality}} that can account for a wider range of phenomena. Branes are [[geometric objects]] similar to {{surfaces}} or {{solids}} that exist in a higher-dimensional space called the '{{bulk}}'. They can have any number of dimensions, from 0 (a {{point}}) to 9 (the maximum number of dimensions in {{string theory}}). Different types of particles and forces are associated with different-dimensional branes. For example, a {{point particle}} might be associated with a 0-dimensional brane (a {{point}}), while a {{photon}} might be associated with a 2-dimensional brane (a {{membrane}}). The interactions between branes and other objects in the bulk give rise to the various particles and forces in the universe. Branes can also be thought of as '{{containers}}' for lower-dimensional objects, such as {{strings}}. In this way, branes provide a natural and elegant way to organize and understand the fundamental building blocks of reality."""
