"To describe and predict the shape and behavior of {\{molecular\}} compounds, enabling a better understanding of their properties and interactions. {\{Molecular Geometry\}} is determined by the arrangement of atoms in three-dimensional {\[space\]}, guided by the shape of electron pairs around the central atom. This shape is influenced by the number of electron pairs, their distribution, and the type of atomic {\{bonds\}}. Geometry types, such as linear, trigonal planar, tetrahedral, and octahedral, help classify and visualize these structures, providing a foundation for understanding molecular properties, chemical reactions, and behavior."
