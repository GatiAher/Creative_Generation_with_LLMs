      "description": "Use of friction for generating heat",
      "mechanism": "Friction generated by the high-speed passage of meteors through the atmosphere causes them to heat up and glow, creating meteor showers."

      "mechanism": "Once the meteors cool down, the surviving meteoroids that reach the ground are called meteorites, which can be studied to unlock valuable information."
