  "purpose": "Inhibitors and Promoters are chemical agents that modulate the pace of reactions, either by reducing (Inhibitors) or enhancing (Promoters) the speed at which reactants interact and transform into products, thereby enabling precise control and customization of chemical processes.",
  "mechanism": "Inhibitors function by binding to the active sites of enzymes or reactants, thereby blocking or distorting the sites where reactions occur, and reducing the probability of successful collisions between reactants, leading to a decrease in reaction rates. Promoters, on the other hand, increase reaction rates by providing additional pathways, lowering activation energies, or binding to enzymes or reactants in ways that facilitate collisions and accelerate the conversion of reactants into products."
