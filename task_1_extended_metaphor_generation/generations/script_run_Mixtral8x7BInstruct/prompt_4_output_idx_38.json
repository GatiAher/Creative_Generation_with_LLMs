      "description": "Segregation",
      "mechanism": "The separation of the two strands during replication ensures that each new DNA molecule contains only one original strand and one newly synthesized strand, reducing the chance of errors."

      "mechanism": "The use of a semi-conservative replication mechanism ensures that the new DNA molecule contains at least one correct strand, reducing the chance of errors and increasing the overall reliability of the system."
