"metaphor": "both Decomposers in ecosystems and Smart Repulsor Technology in Iron Man utilize an efficient feedback loop to maintain balance and sustainability within their respective systems.",
"decomposers": "Decomposers, such as fungi and bacteria, break down complex organic material into simpler compounds, recycling and reusing resources within the ecosystem. This process releases nutrients and byproducts back into the environment, where they can be absorbed and utilized by plants, maintaining a delicate balance within the ecosystem.",
"smart\_repulsor\_technology": "Similarly, Iron Man's Smart Repulsor Technology uses a feedback loop to maintain a stable and sustainable energy output. By constantly monitoring and adjusting the system's energy consumption, it ensures maximum efficiency and longevity, allowing Iron Man to fly and fight for extended periods of time without overheating or running out of energy."
