  "purpose": "The Sudden Stratospheric Warming (SSW) serves as a disruptor to the usual temperature distribution in the Earth's atmosphere, specifically in the stratosphere. Its primary function is to redistribute heat in the stratosphere, which can have significant consequences for weather patterns in the troposphere below.",
  "mechanism": "The SSW is a result of a complex interaction of meteorological phenomena, including changes in atmospheric circulation patterns, planetary wave activity, and temperature gradients. In mathematical terms, the polar vortex, which is a large-scale cyclonic circulation in the stratosphere, can be described as a rotational flow of air around a low-pressure center. The SSW occurs when there is a sudden and significant increase in temperature within this vortex, leading to a weakening or even a complete breakdown of the vortex. This can be represented as a change in the Rossby number, which is a dimensionless quantity used in fluid dynamics to describe the importance of rotation. In the case of the SSW, the Rossby number increases, indicating that the influence of rotation is decreasing. The breakdown of the polar vortex can lead to a reversal of the usual temperature gradient in the stratosphere, with warmer air moving towards the poles and colder air moving towards the equator. This temperature redistribution can have significant consequences for weather patterns in the troposphere, potentially leading to extreme weather events such as cold snaps and heatwaves."
