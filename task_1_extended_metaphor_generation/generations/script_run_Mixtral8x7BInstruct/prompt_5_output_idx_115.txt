A "circular economy" could potentially satisfy the features described in the spec. In a circular economy, resources are kept in use for as long as possible, maximizing the value of each resource, and then recovering and regenerating products and materials at the end of each service life. This is similar to the efficient use and cycling of resources in the spec, as it minimizes waste and optimizes the use of resources. Additionally, a circular economy can also be seen as optimizing resource allocation, as resources are continually reused and repurposed, rather than being discarded and new resources being extracted. However, it is worth noting that the spec specifically mentions "food webs" and the linear structure of these webs, while a circular economy is more of a closed loop system. Therefore, while there are similarities, a circular economy may not perfectly satisfy all the features of the spec.
