"""Volcanic Gas {{plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and atmospheric composition. The gases, primarily water vapor, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrogen sulfide,}} [[contribute to the greenhouse effect, air pressure, and acid rain,]] thereby maintaining the planet's thermal equilibrium and chemical balance. The Volcanic Gas mechanism is rooted in the [[geological processes]] occurring within the Earth's crust. Magma, a [[molten rock mixture,]] contains {{dissolved gases under high pressure and temperature.}} As magma ascends towards the surface during an eruption, the pressure decreases, causing the gases to {{exsolve or come out of solution.}} This release of gases generates [[explosive or effusive eruptions,]] propelling the gases into the atmosphere. The relative amounts of each gas depend on the magma's composition and temperature. The released gases undergo [[chemical reactions and interactions]] with the atmosphere, influencing the climate and atmospheric chemistry.}}"""
