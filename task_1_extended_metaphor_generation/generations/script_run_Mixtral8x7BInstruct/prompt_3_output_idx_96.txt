To ensure uninterrupted service and seamless user experience in a {{distributed system}}, even when one or more components fail, by automatically switching to a backup system. Transparent failover is achieved through a combination of [engineering] and [design] principles, including {{redundancy}}, {{fault tolerance}}, and real-time monitoring. Redundant components are used to create a backup system, with {{mathematical algorithms}} and engineering controls ensuring that they are always in sync with the primary system. Real-time monitoring systems constantly track the health and status of each component, triggering a switch to the backup system as soon as a failure is detected, with no disruption to the user. This process is often described as 'transparent' because it is designed to be invisible to the end-user, with no noticeable change in service or performance.
