  "purpose": "Light Energy enables the perception of visual information, providing a crucial means for interaction with the physical world. It allows for the illumination of spaces, enhancing visibility and safety, and is instrumental in various fields such as engineering, design, and photography.",
  "mechanism": "Composed of electromagnetic waves within the wavelength range of approximately 400-700 nanometers, Light Energy propagates in a straight line, reflecting and refracting when it encounters different surfaces and media. Its geometric properties, including direction, intensity, and color, can be described mathematically using vector equations and trigonometric functions. In engineering and design, these properties are manipulated through the use of lenses, mirrors, filters, and other optical components to control light distribution and maximize its effectiveness."
