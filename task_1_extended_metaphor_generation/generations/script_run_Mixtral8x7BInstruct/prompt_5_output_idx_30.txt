Repulsor Blast propulsion. This feature allows Iron Man to propel himself through the air using the repulsors in his palms, creating friction-based propulsion similar to meteoroids. The size and speed of the repulsor blast can affect its brightness and the distance Iron Man travels, similar to the size and speed-dependent brightness of meteoroids. Additionally, the repulsors can be used offensively, delivering powerful blasts that could potentially survive atmospheric entry and cause geological and biological effects similar to meteorites.
