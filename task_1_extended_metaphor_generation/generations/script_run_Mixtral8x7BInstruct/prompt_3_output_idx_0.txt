Stars, like the Sun, serve as the primary source of energy for their respective solar systems, enabling the existence and development of planets and other {{celestial bodies}}. They provide light, heat, and energy necessary for various chemical and physical processes that support life and shape the conditions of the system. Stars are massive, [[spherical]] formations of plasma, maintained by their own gravitational forces. Through a process called nuclear fusion, hydrogen atoms within the star's core are combined to form helium, releasing enormous amounts of energy in the form of light, heat, and other {{radiations}}. This energy then propagates outward, illuminating and warming the surrounding {{celestial bodies}} in the solar system.}"
