"hubble's\_law": "the measurement of redshift in light emitted by a celestial object as an indicator of its movement and distance, and the use of this measurement to estimate the distance and speed of the object.",
"fandom\_growth\_patterns": "the use of data on fan engagement, such as streaming and social media activity, to estimate the level of interest in a Kpop group and predict future growth."

"hubble's\_law": "the use of evidence from observations of the universe to support the theory of the expanding universe.",
"fandom\_growth\_patterns": "the use of data and evidence from observations of fan behavior to support theories about the growth and development of Kpop fandoms."

Note: The metaphor is just an example and may not be entirely accurate, but it is meant to illustrate the similarities between Hubble's Law and Fandom Growth Patterns in terms of their mechanisms and functions.
