The strike zone.

The strike zone acts as a barrier that hides the complex underlying systems and processes of pitching, maintaining predictability and orderliness in the game. It leverages the fundamental laws of physics, as the pitcher must use the motion of their body and the ball to overcome gravity and air resistance to get the ball over the plate within the strike zone. The strike zone also creates a buffer zone, separating the batter from the pitcher and hiding the pitcher's strategy and techniques from view.
