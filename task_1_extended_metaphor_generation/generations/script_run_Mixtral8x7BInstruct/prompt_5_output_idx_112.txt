"Hierarchical Group Structure"

In the Kpop industry, a common feature is the hierarchical group structure, where each group has a leader, main vocalist, visual, rapper, and other roles. This structure can be seen as analogous to a food web, where each member (or "vector") has a specific role and energy flow is directed in a linear manner. This efficient use and cycling of resources (i.e. member talents and contributions) helps minimize competition and maximize efficiency, as each member is able to focus on their specific role and strengths. Additionally, the hierarchical group structure also facilitates the optimization of resource allocation and waste management, as members are able to specialize in their roles and minimize redundancy or overlap in skills.
