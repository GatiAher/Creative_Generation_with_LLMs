The {{API Gateway}} serves as a centralized entry point for managing and directing {{API}} requests, similar to how a [[compass]] guides a traveler to their desired location in a [[geometric landscape]]. It simplifies the client-side experience by handling tasks such as request routing, authentication, and rate limiting, much like how a [[design]] simplifies a complex system by abstracting away unnecessary details. The {{API Gateway}} is structured as a reverse proxy server that receives API requests and routes them to the appropriate backend services, similar to how an [[engineering blueprint]] outlines a plan for constructing a building. It can [[aggregate]] multiple backend services into a single API call, {{transform}} requests or responses to meet the needs of different clients, and apply logic such as caching or rate limiting. This [[design]] reduces the complexity of client-side applications and improves the scalability and reliability of the overall system.
