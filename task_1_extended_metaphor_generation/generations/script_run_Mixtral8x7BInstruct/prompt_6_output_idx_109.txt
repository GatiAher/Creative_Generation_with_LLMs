Players are scouted, recruited, and trained at lower levels of the system before being promoted to higher levels based on their performance and potential. This structure allows for an efficient distribution and use of resources, maximizing the potential for growth and success of the players and the organization as a whole."

This allows for a high degree of resilience and adaptability within the organization, as the system can continue to produce talent even if a player is traded or released."

As players progress through the system, they have access to more resources and opportunities, but the competition also increases. The pyramid shape represents the decreasing number of players who are able to reach the top level of the system."
