"Ledger-based digital currency systems," such as blockchain technology, have features that could map to the given spec. Here's one possible interpretation:

Feature: "Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT)"

* Modularity: DLT is built from individual transactions, which are the fundamental units of the system, enabling precise tracking and verification of financial transactions.
* Standardized Interfaces: DLT uses cryptographic hashing and specific data structures to ensure the integrity and consistency of transaction data, maintaining the fidelity of the financial records.
* Redundancy: DLT replicates and stores transaction data across multiple nodes in the network, providing stability and resilience to the system.
* Scalability: DLT can handle a growing number of transactions and participants, enabling the creation and growth of financial networks and ecosystems.
* Modifiability: DLT allows for the creation and execution of smart contracts, enabling the automatic modification and execution of financial agreements based on predefined conditions.
