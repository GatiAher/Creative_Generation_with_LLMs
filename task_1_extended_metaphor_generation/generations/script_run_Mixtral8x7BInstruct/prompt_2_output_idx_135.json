  "purpose": "The purpose of the Continental Drift is to explain the observed layout and positioning of the world's continents, as well as their past configurations, in a way that accounts for the physical constraints and properties of large-scale geographical structures.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of the Continental Drift is based on the concept of lithospheric plates, which are large, rigid pieces of the Earth's lithosphere that move relative to each other. These plates are composed of continental and oceanic crust, and they interact at their boundaries through processes such as seafloor spreading, subduction, and transform motion. Over time, the movement of these plates can result in the drift of continents, leading to changes in the Earth's large-scale geographical features and the formation of new ones. The movement of the plates is driven by convection currents in the underlying mantle, which transfer heat from the interior of the Earth to its surface, causing the lithosphere to move and deform."
