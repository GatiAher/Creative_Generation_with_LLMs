The {{Kuiper Belt}} is a {{reservoir}} of icy bodies that serves as a source of comets visiting the inner solar system. It provides a stable, distant region where these bodies can exist without being significantly affected by the gravity of the larger planets. The {{Kuiper Belt}} is a [{{disk}}]-shaped region, with its objects orbiting the Sun in roughly the same plane as the planets. This [{{disk}}] extends from the orbit of Neptune to approximately 55 AU from the Sun. The region's distance from the Sun and its flat, [{{disk}}]-like structure allows for the stability of its icy bodies, as they are not affected by the heat of the Sun or the gravitational forces of the larger planets. The Kuiper Belt's location and structure also allows for a steady supply of comets to be sent towards the inner solar system, as gravitational interactions with nearby objects can perturb their orbits and send them on trajectories that bring them closer to the Sun.
