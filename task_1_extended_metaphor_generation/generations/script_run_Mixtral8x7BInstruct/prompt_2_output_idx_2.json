  "purpose": "Dwarf Planets serve as key markers in understanding the composition and history of our solar system. They, along with other celestial bodies, provide valuable insights into the geometric patterns and mathematical relationships that govern the behavior of objects in space.",
  "mechanism": "Dwarf Planets are spherical in shape, which is a result of their gravitational forces and material composition. This geometric shape allows them to have a large surface area in relation to their volume, which can increase the chances of detecting and studying them. The orbits of Dwarf Planets follow elliptical paths around the sun, which can be described using mathematical equations. The orbits of these celestial bodies also often intersect with other debris, demonstrating the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the solar system. Despite not having cleared their orbits, Dwarf Planets still meet many of the same geometric, mathematical, and engineering principles that define other planets."
