  "purpose": "Abiotic factors provide the physical conditions necessary for organisms to survive, thrive, and interact within an ecosystem. They serve as the foundation for the geometric arrangement and mathematical relationships between living organisms and their non-living environment.",
  "mechanism": "Composed of various measurable elements, abiotic factors follow engineering and design principles to create a stable or dynamic framework. These factors include temperature (a measure of thermal energy), light (electromagnetic waves with specific wavelengths), water (a solvent and medium for chemical reactions), and soil composition (a mixture of minerals, organic matter, and pore space). The specific values and ranges of these factors define the geometric and mathematical constraints within which organisms must adapt and optimize their growth, reproduction, and resource utilization."
