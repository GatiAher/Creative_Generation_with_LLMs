"Decentralized Financial Systems (DeFi)"

DeFi systems, such as cryptocurrency networks, exhibit the features of redundancy, interconnected network, design matrix, and complex system. They have multiple nodes (computers) that validate transactions and maintain a copy of the ledger, allowing for redundancy and recovery from disturbances. These nodes are interconnected, forming a network that enables multiple pathways for transactions. The design of DeFi systems is matrix-like, where each node is connected to and interacts with many others, leading to robustness and adaptability. Lastly, DeFi systems are complex systems composed of various components, such as smart contracts, wallets, and exchanges, that fulfill different roles and functions, contributing to a robust and adaptable system.
