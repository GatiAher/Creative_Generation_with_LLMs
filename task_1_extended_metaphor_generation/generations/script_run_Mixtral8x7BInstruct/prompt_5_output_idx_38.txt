"Advanced Repulsor Technology": This feature can be used to maintain a stable orbit, as repulsors can generate a stable force field to keep Iron Man at a safe distance from other objects. The repulsor technology can be arranged in a flat, disk-like structure to minimize gravitational interactions and maintain stability. The temperature of the repulsor field can be controlled to regulate the temperature of Iron Man and prevent damage from extreme temperatures. Finally, the repulsor technology can be used to perturb the trajectories of nearby objects, sending them on trajectories towards a desired target, thus satisfying the requirement for gravitational perturbations.
