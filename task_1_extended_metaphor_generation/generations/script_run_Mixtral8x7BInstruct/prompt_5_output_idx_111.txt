A "financial food chain" with a "pyramid of wealth" representation could potentially satisfy all the features of the spec.

Just as energy is transferred and converted within an ecosystem's trophic system, money flows through a financial system in a hierarchical manner, with different levels representing various stages of production, consumption, and investment. This financial "food chain" can be thought of as an efficient distribution and use of financial resources, maximizing the potential for economic growth and development.

Additionally, the financial system can be seen as a modular and self-organizing system, where the addition or removal of financial actors or institutions at one level does not necessarily affect the functioning of the other levels. This allows for a high degree of resilience and adaptability within the financial system.

Finally, the "pyramid of wealth" is a geometric representation that visualizes the distribution of wealth and income in a society, with a narrowing base representing the decreasing number of individuals who control a larger portion of the society's wealth. This pyramid shape can help illustrate the decreasing amount of financial resources available at each higher level of the financial food chain.
