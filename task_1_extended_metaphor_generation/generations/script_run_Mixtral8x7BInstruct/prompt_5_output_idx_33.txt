"The use of spin and air resistance to curve pitches" could be a feature in the domain of baseball that satisfies all the features of the spec. Here's how:

* Use of gravitational field for capturing meteoroids: In baseball, the baseball is affected by the gravitational field of the Earth, which keeps it in a curved path as it moves towards the batter.
* Use of friction for generating heat: The friction between the air and the spinning surface of the baseball causes it to heat up slightly, which can affect the aerodynamics of the ball.
* Use of cooling for survival of meteoroids: While not directly applicable to baseball, the concept of cooling is still relevant in the sense that the baseball must cool down to its original temperature after being thrown, otherwise it could affect the grip of the pitcher or the feel of the ball for the batter.
* Use of mathematical and scientific techniques for analysis: There are many mathematical and scientific techniques used in baseball to analyze pitches and player performance, such as biomechanics, physics, and statistics. For example, the Magnus force, which is a force that acts on a spinning ball in a fluid (such as air), can be used to explain the movement of curveballs and other breaking balls. Additionally, video analysis and motion capture technology can be used to study the biomechanics of pitching and hitting.
