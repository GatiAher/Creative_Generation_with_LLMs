The {{Stratosphere}} serves as a protective barrier, absorbing harmful ultraviolet radiation from the sun and regulating the Earth's climate. It also provides a stable environment for high-altitude flights and weather phenomena. The Stratosphere is a [[horizontal layer]] with a varying thickness, located at a height of approximately 10-50 km above the Earth's surface. Its unique property of increasing temperature with height, unlike the troposphere below, is due to the presence of the ozone layer. This [[layer]] absorbs the sun's ultraviolet radiation, converting it into heat and raising the temperature. The stability of the Stratosphere results from the lack of vertical mixing, which is due to the weak [[turbulence]] and the stable temperature gradient. This stability supports its role in high-altitude aviation and weather patterns.
