The purpose of **"Activation Energy"** is to act as a "{{barrier}}" or "{{gate}}" that needs to be overcome for a reaction to take place, ensuring that reactions only occur when sufficient energy is provided, much like a minimum power requirement in [{{engineering design}}]. This concept is crucial in controlling reactions and ensuring they occur under desired conditions. **"Activation Energy"** is mathematically represented as the difference between the energy of the reactants and the {{transition state}} (a high-energy state that represents the "{{activated complex}}" in the reaction). This [{{geometry}}] interpretation in terms of potential energy surfaces helps visualize the reaction pathway and the energy barrier that needs to be overcome for the reaction to proceed. In the context of [{{engineering}}] and design, one can think of this as a "{{hill}}" that needs to be climbed before reaching the desired product state.
