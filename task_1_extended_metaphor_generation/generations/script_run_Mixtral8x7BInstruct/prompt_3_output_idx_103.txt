The {{Troposphere}} is the region of the {{atmosphere}} that provides the necessary conditions for weather patterns, temperature regulation, and supports life on Earth by acting as a medium for heat distribution and energy exchange. The {{Troposphere}} has a [[radial stratification]] where temperature decreases with height, following a lapse rate that varies with latitude and season. This temperature gradient creates a [[convective system]] that drives heat transport from the equator to the poles. The decrease in temperature with height also creates a [[pressure gradient]], which, in combination with the Earth's rotation, influences wind patterns and air circulation. The {{Troposphere}}'s [[geometry]] and thermal properties create a stable, dynamic system that ensures a relatively uniform temperature distribution across the planet and facilitates weather events.
