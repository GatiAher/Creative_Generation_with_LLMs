  "purpose": "gRPC is a powerful and efficient communication system that enables different software components to interact with each other seamlessly, regardless of the programming languages or platforms they use. It's like a universal translator that facilitates the exchange of data and information between different engineering systems, ensuring they can work together harmoniously.",
  "mechanism": "gRPC is based on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) model, which allows one software component (the client) to invoke a method on another component (the server) as if it were a local procedure. The communication is done using HTTP/2 protocol, which provides features like bidirectional streaming, header compression, and connection multiplexing. The interface description language used is Protocol Buffers, a language- and platform-neutral binary serialization format that offers compact, efficient, and reliable data transfer. Together, these technologies enable gRPC to provide fast, secure, and scalable communication between different engineering and design systems, ensuring smooth data flow and seamless integration."
