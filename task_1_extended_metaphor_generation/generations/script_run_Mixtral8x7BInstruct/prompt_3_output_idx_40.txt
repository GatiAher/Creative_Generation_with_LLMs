The {{translation process}} serves as a {{blueprint-to-product assembly line}}, converting the information-rich genetic code into a physical protein product through a series of precise steps and calculations, much like a manufacturing process in [engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering). The genetic code, represented as a sequence of nucleotides in RNA, undergoes a systematic mapping process to assign specific amino acids. This mapping process involves a '{{reader}}' ({{Ribosome}})</wikipedia> and '{{instructional guides}}' (tRNA molecules), which interact in a coordinated and [geometrically-constrained manner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry) to facilitate the addition of amino acids to a growing protein chain. The process adheres to a strict '{{start-stop}}' mechanism, similar to a [programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language), to ensure accurate and controlled protein synthesis.
