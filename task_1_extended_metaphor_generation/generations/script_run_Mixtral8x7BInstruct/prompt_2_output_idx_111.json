  "purpose": "Air pollution is a phenomenon that arises from the introduction of harmful or excessive substances into the Earth's atmosphere, with the aim of serving human needs and activities such as transportation, energy production, and industrialization. However, this comes at the cost of negatively impacting air quality and human health.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of air pollution involves the emission of pollutants, which are often gases or particles, into the atmosphere. These pollutants can be primary, meaning they are directly emitted, or secondary, meaning they are formed in the atmosphere through chemical reactions. The pollutants then disperse and mix in the atmosphere, affecting its composition and leading to the formation of pollution 'plumes'. The density, size, and distribution of these plumes are influenced by factors such as wind patterns, atmospheric stability, and temperature gradients, which can be described using mathematical equations and models. The concentration of pollutants and their impact on air quality and human health are also subject to geometric principles, such as the distance between the source and the receptor, and the volume and capacity of the affected air space. The design and engineering of systems and processes that emit pollutants play a crucial role in mitigating the negative effects of air pollution."
