  "purpose": "The catalyst serves as an accelerator for chemical reactions, enabling them to reach their end state more quickly and efficiently, while itself remaining unchanged in the process.",
  "mechanism": "Catalysts function by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy compared to the original reaction. This is achieved through their unique geometric and structural properties, which allow them to facilitate the formation and breaking of bonds in a way that reduces the overall energy barrier for the reaction to occur. The mathematical underpinning of this process can be described by the Arrhenius equation, which relates the rate constant of a reaction to the activation energy and temperature. In terms of engineering and design, catalysts are often created with specific shapes, sizes, and compositions to optimize their performance and efficiency in particular reactions."
