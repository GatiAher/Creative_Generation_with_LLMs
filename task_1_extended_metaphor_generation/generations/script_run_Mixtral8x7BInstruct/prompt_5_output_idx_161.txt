"Signal-calling system in baseball"

Explanation:

* A signal-calling system in baseball is like a "blueprint-to-product assembly line" because it involves a series of precise steps and signals to coordinate the actions of the players on the field.
* The signal-calling system is also a "systematic mapping process" because it uses a set of pre-defined signs and codes to communicate specific instructions to the players.
* Finally, the signal-calling system is a "start-stop mechanism" because it allows the team to control the game and make strategic decisions in a precise and coordinated manner, similar to a programming language.
