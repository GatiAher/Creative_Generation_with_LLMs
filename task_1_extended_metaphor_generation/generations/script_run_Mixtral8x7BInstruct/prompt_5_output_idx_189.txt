"Pitching Rubber"

Explanation:

* Specialization of cells for hormone production: The pitching rubber is specifically designed for pitchers to throw the ball, allowing for efficient and targeted pitches.
* Optimization of environmental conditions: The pitching rubber is placed at a certain distance from home plate to optimize the conditions for pitching and hitting.
* Redundancy and backup systems: The presence of multiple pitchers and pitching strategies ensures that there is a backup system in place in case of failure or damage to the starting pitcher.
* Homeostasis and regulation: The pitching rubber helps maintain a balance between pitching and hitting, which supports the overall competitive and strategic well-being of the game.
* Modularity and compartmentalization: The pitching rubber is a separate component of the baseball field, allowing for the separation of functions (pitching and hitting) and ensuring that any issues with the pitching rubber do not affect other aspects of the game.
