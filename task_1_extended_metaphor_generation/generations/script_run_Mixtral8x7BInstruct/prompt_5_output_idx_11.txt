"Interconnectedness of global economies," which can be described as follows:

Gravitational forces determine shape: The interconnectedness of global economies is shaped by various factors such as trade agreements, economic policies, and international relations, which can be thought of as the "gravitational forces" that determine the shape of the global economy. This complex system of interconnections maximizes the exchange of goods, services, and capital between countries, much like how gravitational forces and material composition result in a spherical shape that maximizes surface area for a given volume in celestial bodies.

Use of mathematical equations to describe motion: The interconnectedness of global economies can be analyzed and predicted using mathematical models and equations. For example, economists use input-output models, regression analysis, and other statistical tools to understand the relationships between different economic variables and to forecast future economic trends. These mathematical tools allow for the prediction and analysis of the motion of the global economy.

Intersection of orbits: The interconnectedness of global economies often intersects with other factors such as political instability, natural disasters, and technological changes, demonstrating the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the global economy. These intersections can have significant impacts on the global economy, just as the intersection of orbits between celestial bodies can have significant impacts on their trajectories.

Geometric and mathematical principles in planet definition: Despite the complex and dynamic nature of the global economy, it can still be analyzed and understood using geometric, mathematical, and engineering principles. For example, economists use concepts such as supply and demand, market equilibrium, and production functions to analyze and understand the behavior of the global economy. These principles allow for the definition and analysis of the global economy, much like how geometric, mathematical, and engineering principles are used to define and analyze celestial bodies.
