"Monetary Policy Modeling"

This feature involves using mathematical models and differential equations to describe the behavior of money supply, interest rates, and other monetary variables. The scale factor can represent the money supply, and the second-order differential equation can describe its rate of change. Homogeneity and isotropy can be assumed in the economic space, where all economic agents have equal access to money and financial markets. Curvature can represent the state of the economy, whether it's in a recession (closed), stable (flat), or inflationary (open) state. Computer simulations can help understand the evolution of initial conditions and interactions between different economic variables and policies.
