Text: ""Tephra serves as a {\{natural disaster management system\}} by providing a protective layer and reducing soil erosion, contributing to the formation of new fertile soil that supports vegetation growth. Tephra is composed of {\{angular\}}, irregularly shaped pyroclastic fragments with varying sizes, from volcanic bombs to fine ash. The [geometry] of these fragments interlocks and interlocks, creating a porous and permeable structure that can absorb and retain water. This [porosity] also allows for the insulation of underlying surfaces from extreme temperatures, providing a protective barrier. The math of tephra's structure is characterized by its grain size distribution, which follows a {\{log-normal pattern\}}. The [engineering] and [design] aspects of tephra involve the understanding of its mechanical properties, such as shear strength, permeability, and angle of repose, which determine its ability to support structures and resist erosion."""
