{Stable isotopes} provide a tool for studying the past and present processes of various systems, such as the environment, climate, and biological systems, through {isotope analysis}. By examining the ratios of heavy to light {isotopes}, researchers can gain insights into the history and dynamics of these systems, without the need for radioactive dating. {Stable isotopes} are atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons, resulting in different masses. The principles of [geometry], [math], [engineering], and [design] come into play in isotope analysis, where the ratios of heavy to light isotopes are measured with high precision. This involves the use of [mass spectrometry], a technique that separates and quantifies isotopes based on their mass-to-charge ratio. The design of mass spectrometers involves the precise engineering of electrical and magnetic fields, and the [geometry] of the instrument determines the resolution and accuracy of the isotope measurements. The data obtained from isotope analysis is then analyzed using mathematical models and statistical methods, providing insights into the system's history and dynamics.
