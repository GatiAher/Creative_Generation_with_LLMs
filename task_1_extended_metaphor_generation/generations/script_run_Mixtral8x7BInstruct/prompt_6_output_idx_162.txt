"metaphor": "both Translation in DNA and Nanotechnology-based self-assembling systems in Iron Man have a blueprint-to-product assembly line (string)",
"translation": "The genetic code in DNA serves as a blueprint for the production of proteins, which are essential for various cellular functions. This process involves a series of precise steps and calculations, similar to a manufacturing process in engineering.",
"nanotechnology-based\_self-assembling\_systems": "In Iron Man, nanotechnology-based self-assembling systems follow a set of instructions to construct and assemble materials into desired products, such as the suit's components. These systems convert digital information into physical products, mirroring the way genetic code is translated into proteins."

{
"metaphor": "both Translation in DNA and Nanotechnology-based self-assembling systems in Iron Man have a systematic mapping process (string)",
"translation": "Translation of genetic code into amino acids involves a 'reader' (Ribosome) and 'instructional guides' (tRNA molecules) that interact in a coordinated and geometrically-constrained manner. This process is systematic and ensures the accurate mapping of the genetic code to its corresponding amino acids.",
"nanotechnology-based\_self-assembling\_systems": "Similarly, nanotechnology-based self-assembling systems in Iron Man follow a systematic and coordinated process to assemble materials. The instructions for assembly are precise and constrained, ensuring the accurate and efficient construction of the desired product."

{
"metaphor": "both Translation in DNA and Nanotechnology-based self-assembling systems in Iron Man have a start-stop mechanism (string)",
"translation": "Translation of genetic code into proteins involves a strict mechanism to ensure accurate and controlled protein synthesis. This mechanism is similar to a programming language, with specific start and stop signals that control the initiation and termination of protein synthesis.",
"nanotechnology-based\_self-assembling\_systems": "In Iron Man's nanotechnology-based self-assembling systems, a strict start-stop mechanism is also in place to control the assembly process. This ensures that the construction of the desired product is accurate and efficient, similar to the way genetic code is translated into proteins."
