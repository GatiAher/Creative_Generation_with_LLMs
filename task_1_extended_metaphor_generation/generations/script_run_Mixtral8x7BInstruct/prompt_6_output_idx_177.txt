Note:

* The above is a rough example of how the output might look like, the metaphor, adrenal\_glands and pitch\_selection\_and\_sequencing\_by\_a\_pitching\_coach are open for more creative and accurate representation of the similarities between the two.
* The metaphor is trying to convey the idea that both the Adrenal Glands and Pitch selection and sequencing by a pitching coach in baseball are systems that monitor and adjust to maintain balance and optimize performance, they both have a dual structure that allows for a wide range of responses and adaptability, they both use control signals to affect the function of various organs and systems and they both can be compared to an engineering control system with input and output.
