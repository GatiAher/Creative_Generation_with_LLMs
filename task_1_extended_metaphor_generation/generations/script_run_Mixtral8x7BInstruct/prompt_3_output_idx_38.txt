The purpose of **"Replication"** is to ensure accurate transmission of genetic information from one cell generation to the next, by creating an exact copy of the DNA molecule's **"design and structure"**. The mechanism of **"Replication"** involves the unwinding of the double helix **"structure"** of DNA at the **"origin of replication"**, followed by the separation of the two strands. This exposes the base pairs, which then serve as templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands. The process is **"semi-conservative"**, meaning that each new DNA molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. The assembly of the new strands is facilitated by **"enzymes"**, with the leading strand synthesized continuously and the lagging strand synthesized in short, discontinuous segments known as Okazaki fragments. The resulting replicated DNA molecules have **"identical geometric design"**, base pair sequences, and genetic information as the original molecule, ensuring faithful inheritance of genetic traits.
