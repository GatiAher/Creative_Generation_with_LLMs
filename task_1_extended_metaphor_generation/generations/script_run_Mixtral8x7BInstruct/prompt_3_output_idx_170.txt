"""M-Theory is a unifying framework, aimed at {{reconciling}} various {{string theories}} and {{supergravity theories}}, providing a consistent mathematical model for understanding the fundamental forces and {{particles}} in the universe. M-Theory is formulated in a {{"11-dimensional space-time"}}, which incorporates the extra dimensions proposed by {{string theory}}. It encompasses five distinct string theories (Type I, Type IIA, Type IIB, Heterotic SO(32), and Heterotic E8xE8) as different {{limits}} or {{aspects}} of the same underlying structure. The theory involves {{membranes}} (2-dimensional objects) and {{fivebranes}} (5-dimensional objects) in addition to one-dimensional strings. This {{geometrical}} and mathematical richness allows for a more comprehensive description of the fundamental interactions and particles, potentially offering a more unified and elegant explanation for nature's phenomena."""
