""{{Lewis Structures}} serve as a simple yet effective tool to visualize the arrangement of atoms and the distribution of valence electrons in a molecular compound, facilitating an understanding of the compound's formation and properties in a {\[geometric and mathematical\] context}. {{Lewis Structures}} are constructed by following a set of {\[engineering and design\] principles}. Each atom is represented by its symbol, and valence electrons are denoted by dots around the atom. The structure is designed to satisfy the octet rule, ensuring that each atom, except for hydrogen, is surrounded by eight electrons, which creates a stable configuration. For molecular compounds, lines are used to connect atoms, reflecting the bonding pattern and overall geometry. The total number of electrons in the {{Lewis Structure}} should equal the sum of valence electrons from all atoms involved, accounting for any charge. This systematic approach enables chemists to analyze and predict the stability, shape, and reactivity of molecular compounds."""
