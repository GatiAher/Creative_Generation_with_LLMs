Arc Reactor

The Arc Reactor is a centralized energy source in Iron Man's suit, powering and supporting all the surrounding systems and components. It utilizes the process of nuclear fusion, similar to stars, to generate energy by combining atomic nuclei. The Arc Reactor also demonstrates gravitational force, as it maintains the structural integrity and formation of the suit due to its own energy field. Lastly, the energy produced by the Arc Reactor propagates throughout the suit and its surroundings, allowing for various functionalities and protecting Tony Stark.
