To release pressure and heat from within the Earth, while also shaping the "landscape and creating new [landforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landform)." "[Lava](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava)" is a fluid-like substance with high temperature and "[viscosity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity)," which allows it to flow and take on various shapes as it cools and solidifies. Its behavior can be described using "[mathematical equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model) of fluid dynamics," and its "[mechanical properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanical_property)" such as viscosity and density are determined by the composition of the "[magma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magma)" from which it originates. "[Engineers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer)" and "[designers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designer)" use this knowledge to model and predict lava flow patterns, and to design structures and infrastructure that can withstand their impact.
