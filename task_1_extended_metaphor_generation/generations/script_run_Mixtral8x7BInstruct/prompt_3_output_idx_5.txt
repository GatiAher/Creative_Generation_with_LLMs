"Comets serve as {{time capsules}} that provide {[valuable information]} about the early solar system, as they are composed of materials that have remained relatively unchanged since the formation of the solar system. They also help in the redistribution of matter and energy within the solar system. Comets are composed of a nucleus made up of {{ice}} and rock, which {{vaporizes}} when it gets close to the Sun, creating an atmosphere or {{coma}}. The vaporization process releases {{dust}} and gas, which form a tail that points away from the Sun due to the pressure of solar radiation and the {{solar wind}}. The shape and behavior of the comet, including its orbit, tail direction, and brightness, can be explained by {{geometric principles}}, mathematical calculations, and engineering concepts related to motion, force, and energy."
