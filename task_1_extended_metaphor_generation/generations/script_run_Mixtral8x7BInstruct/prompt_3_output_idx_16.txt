"Nucleosynthesis" is the process that explains the formation of the "lightest elements" in the universe, which is a crucial step in the evolution of the "cosmos", enabling the existence of "stars", "galaxies", and ultimately life as we know it. The mechanism of "Nucleosynthesis" can be described as follows: In the aftermath of the Big Bang, the universe was extremely hot and dense, filled with subatomic particles called "quarks". As the universe expanded and cooled, these quarks combined to form "protons" and "neutrons", which further combined to make "atomic nuclei". This process was primarily driven by the high temperatures and densities, as well as the fundamental forces of nature, such as the "[strong nuclear force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_nuclear_force)".

The most abundant elements produced were "hydrogen (^1H)" and "helium (^4He)", with trace amounts of "lithium (^7Li)". The relative abundances of these elements can be calculated using the "[physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) of nuclear reactions", and these calculations are in good agreement with "[observations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observational_cosmology)" of the universe today. This supports the Big Bang theory and the idea that "Nucleosynthesis" occurred in the first few minutes after the Big Bang.
