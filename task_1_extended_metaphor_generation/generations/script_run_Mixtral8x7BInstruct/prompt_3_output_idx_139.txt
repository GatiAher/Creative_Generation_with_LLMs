The {{Divergent Boundary}} serves as a mechanism for the creation of new crust on the Earth's surface, facilitating the continuous growth and renewal of the planet's lithosphere. At a {{Divergent Boundary}}}, the [[opposing forces]] of tectonic plate movement cause a [[gap]] to form, which is filled by magma rising from the mantle below. As the magma cools and solidifies, it becomes new crust, gradually separating the two plates and increasing their [[distance]] from each other. This process can manifest as mid-ocean ridges in the oceanic lithosphere or rift valleys in the continental lithosphere.
