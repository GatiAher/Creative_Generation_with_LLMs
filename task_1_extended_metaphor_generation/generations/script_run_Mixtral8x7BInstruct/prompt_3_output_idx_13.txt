The Inflationary Universe serves to address several issues in the Big Bang theory, such as the {{horizon problem}} and {{flatness problem}}, by positing a period of exponential expansion in the early universe. This rapid expansion helps to explain the uniformity of the {{cosmic microwave background radiation}} and the [[large-scale structure]] of the universe. The mechanism behind the Inflationary Universe involves a phase of rapid, accelerated expansion driven by a negative-pressure vacuum energy density, or [[dark energy]]. This expansion is characterized by a [[scale factor]] that increases exponentially with time, resulting in a rapid 'inflation' of the universe. The [[homogeneity]] and [[isotropy]] of the universe are preserved during this period, leading to the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe.
