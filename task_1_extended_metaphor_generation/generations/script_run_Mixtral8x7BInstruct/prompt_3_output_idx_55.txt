"Exothermic and Endothermic Reactions are fundamental to the concept of {{energy changes}} in chemical reactions, where energy is {{transferred}} or {{absorbed}}, enabling various industrial, biological, and [[engineering]] processes. They serve as a basis for heat-driven reactions, thermal insulation, refrigeration, and energy storage. Exothermic reactions occur when the total energy of the {{products}} is less than the total energy of the {{reactants}}," releasing the difference as heat to the surroundings. "This can be likened to a geometric structure where the energy difference between the initial and final states forms a negative value, resulting in heat emission."

On the other hand, endothermic reactions {{absorb}} heat from the surroundings as the total energy of the products is greater than the total energy of the reactants, creating a positive energy difference." This can be compared to a [[design]] where energy is absorbed to facilitate the transition between states." In both cases, the energy balance is crucial to the overall process and can be described using mathematical equations to quantify the energy transferred."
