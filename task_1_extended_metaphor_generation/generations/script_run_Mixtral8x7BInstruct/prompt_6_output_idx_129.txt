In this metaphor, the nucleotides in DNA are compared to pre-defined baseball positions in terms of their modularity, standardization, scalability, and abstraction. Nucleotides act as fundamental building blocks, with a consistent composition that allows for predictable and reliable interaction, enabling the encoding of a large amount of genetic information in a single DNA molecule. Similarly, pre-defined baseball positions act as individual roles that, when combined with other positions, form a complete baseball team. Each position has a specific function and set of responsibilities that contribute to the overall success of the team, allowing for scalability, predictability and reliability in interactions and abstraction of higher level information.
