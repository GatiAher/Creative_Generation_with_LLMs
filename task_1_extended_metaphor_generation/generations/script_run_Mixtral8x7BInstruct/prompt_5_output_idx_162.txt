"Nanotechnology-based self-assembling systems" - This feature in Iron Man's suit uses a series of precise steps and calculations to convert design blueprints into physical products, similar to a manufacturing process. It also employs a systematic mapping process using nanobots as 'readers' and 'instructional guides' to construct the suit's components. Lastly, it has a start-stop mechanism that allows for accurate and controlled self-assembly, much like a programming language.
