  "purpose": "Atmospheric circulation plays a crucial role in redistributing heat energy across the Earth's surface, thereby regulating global temperatures and driving weather patterns. It enables the transfer of heat from the tropics to higher latitudes, maintaining a relatively stable climate.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of atmospheric circulation is based on the principles of fluid dynamics, geometry, and engineering. Solar radiation heats the Earth's surface unevenly, leading to temperature differences. This generates pressure gradients, causing air to move from high-pressure to low-pressure areas. The Coriolis effect, an apparent force caused by the Earth's rotation, influences the direction of airflow, causing it to veer right in the Northern Hemisphere and left in the Southern Hemisphere. This results in large-scale circulation patterns, including Hadley cells, Ferrel cells, and Polar cells, which facilitate the transfer of heat and moisture around the globe."
