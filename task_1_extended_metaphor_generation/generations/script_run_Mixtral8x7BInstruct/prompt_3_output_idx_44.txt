The {{Adrenal Glands}} are responsible for maintaining homeostasis within the human body by producing hormones that regulate stress response, metabolism, and blood pressure. They act as a [[control system]](), constantly monitoring the body's internal and external environment and releasing hormones as needed to maintain balance. The {{Adrenal Glands}} are composed of two distinct regions: the outer cortex and the inner medulla. The [[cortex]]() is responsible for producing hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone, which regulate metabolism and blood pressure respectively. The [[medulla]]() produces adrenaline, which is released in response to stress. This dual structure allows for the {{Adrenal Glands}} to respond to a wide range of stimuli and maintain homeostasis through the release of specific hormones. The {{Adrenal Glands}} can be thought of as a complex [[control system]](), with the cortex and medulla acting as sensors and actuators, constantly monitoring the body's internal and external environment and releasing hormones as needed to maintain balance. The hormones produced by the {{Adrenal Glands}} can be thought of as control signals, which [[travel through the body]]() and affect the function of various organs and systems. The {{Adrenal Glands}}' structure and function can be compared to that of a [[engineering control system]](), where the input is the body's internal and external environment, and the output is the hormones that are released to maintain homeostasis.
