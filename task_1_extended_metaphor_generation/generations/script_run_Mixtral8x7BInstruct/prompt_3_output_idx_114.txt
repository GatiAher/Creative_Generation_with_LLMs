The scale of a {{topographic map}} serves to maintain proportionality between the depicted features and their real-world counterparts, enabling accurate measurements and assessments of relative distances, sizes, and {{angles}}. The scale is typically represented as a fraction, where the numerator is the distance on the {{map}} and the denominator is the corresponding distance in the real world. This ratio establishes a proportional relationship between {{map distances}} and actual distances. Additionally, a {{bar scale}} can be included, providing a visual representation of the scale, with a given length on the map corresponding to its real-world equivalent.
