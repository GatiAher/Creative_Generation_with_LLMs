  "purpose": "Contour lines serve as a tool in visualizing the three-dimensional (3D) structure and features of a two-dimensional (2D) surface or terrain, enabling informed decision-making in various fields such as engineering, design, and outdoor activities.",
  "mechanism": "Contour lines are mathematically defined as isocurves, connecting points of equal elevation on a surface. These lines are evenly spaced apart, with the spacing denoting the rate of change in elevation. By analyzing the pattern, density, and direction of these lines, one can infer information about the slope, steepness, and shape of the terrain. The absence of contour lines in certain areas implies a constant elevation or flat terrain. The meeting or crossing of contour lines indicates a change in elevation, with the point of intersection marking a peak, valley, or saddle. Additionally, the closeness of contour lines indicates a steeper slope, while widely spaced lines indicate a gentler slope."
