The {{Reaction Mechanism}} serves as a blueprint that breaks down the transformation of {{reactants}} into {{products}} into a series of smaller, manageable steps. It is a crucial tool in understanding the sequence and energy requirements of a {{chemical reaction}}. The {{Reaction Mechanism}} is a multi-step process, where each step involves a specific [[geometry]] and a change in their energy levels. This mechanism can be represented mathematically through {{rate equations}} and energy diagrams, which describe the change in concentration of reactants and products over time and the energy barriers between steps, respectively. The design of a {{Reaction Mechanism}} is informed by principles from [[engineering]], such as optimizing the efficiency of the reaction and minimizing unwanted side reactions.
