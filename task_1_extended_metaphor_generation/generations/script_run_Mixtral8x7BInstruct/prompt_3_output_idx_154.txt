"Light Energy ({\\physics}) enables the perception of visual information, providing a crucial means for interaction with the physical world. It allows for the illumination of spaces, enhancing visibility and safety, and is instrumental in various fields such as [[engineering]] and [[design]] (specifically illumination design), and [[photography]]. Composed of electromagnetic waves within the wavelength range of approximately 400-700 nanometers, Light Energy ({\\physics}) propagates in a straight line, reflecting and refracting when it encounters different surfaces and media. Its [[geometry]] properties, including direction, intensity, and color, can be described mathematically using vector equations and trigonometric functions. In [[engineering]] and [[design]], these properties are manipulated through the use of lenses, mirrors, filters, and other optical components ({\\physics}) to control light distribution and maximize its effectiveness."
