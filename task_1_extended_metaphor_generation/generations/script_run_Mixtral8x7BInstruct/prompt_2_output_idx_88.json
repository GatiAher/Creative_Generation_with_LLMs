  "purpose": "The GraphQL API is designed to enable efficient and flexible data retrieval and manipulation for users, allowing them to specify the data they need in a single request, much like requesting a customized report from a database. This leads to reduced network usage, faster data retrieval, and a more tailored user experience.",
  "mechanism": "GraphQL uses a schema-driven approach to define the structure and availability of data. The schema acts as a contract between the client and the server, outlining the possible queries, mutations, and the types of data that can be requested or modified. Clients can query for specific fields, and the server responds with only the requested data, minimizing over- or under-fetching. Clients can also perform complex operations, such as nested queries and relationships, in a single request, simplifying the data retrieval process and enhancing user experience."
