The {{Event Horizon}} serves as a demarcation point in the realm of {{geometry}} and physics, defining the limit beyond which matter and energy cannot return to the external universe, thus ensuring the black hole's isolation and preservation. The {{Event Horizon}} is formed by the black hole's extreme gravitational forces, which distort spacetime such that a [[spherical surface]] (in Schwarzschild black holes) is created, acting as a one-way membrane. This membrane's {{geometry}} and the underlying mathematics, represented by Einstein's field equations, control the behavior of matter and energy, preventing anything from escaping the black hole's grasp.
