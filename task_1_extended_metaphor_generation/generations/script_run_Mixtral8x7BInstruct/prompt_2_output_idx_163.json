  "purpose": "The String Theory serves to unify various fields in physics, including quantum mechanics and general relativity, by proposing that fundamental particles are not point-like but rather one-dimensional 'strings'. This theory aims to provide a consistent and comprehensive framework to explain the behavior of matter and energy at all scales, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies.",
  "mechanism": "In the String Theory, these 'strings' vibrate at different frequencies, and the frequency of vibration determines the mass and charge of the particle it represents. The geometry of the strings and the space they vibrate in (known as the Calabi-Yau manifold) play a crucial role in determining the properties of these particles. The mathematical and geometric properties of these manifolds and strings are used to derive the laws of physics, including the fundamental forces and the behavior of particles. The theory also incorporates the principles of supersymmetry, which postulates that every particle has a superpartner with different spin statistics. The design of the String Theory is based on the principles of string duality, which relates different string theories and allows for the calculation of quantities in regimes where traditional perturbative methods fail."
