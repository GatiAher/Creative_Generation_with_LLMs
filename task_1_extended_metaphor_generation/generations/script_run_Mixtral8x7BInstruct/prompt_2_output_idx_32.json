  "purpose": "The nucleotide is a fundamental building block in the design of DNA, akin to a pixel in a digital image or a Lego brick in a larger structure.",
  "mechanism": "Each nucleotide is composed of a sugar molecule (deoxyribose in the case of DNA) acting as a base, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base, which can be adenine, guanine, cytosine, or thymine. The phosphate group of one nucleotide connects to the sugar molecule of the next, creating a long chain. The specific sequence of these nitrogenous bases encodes genetic information, similar to how the sequence of letters in a word or pieces in a Lego set dictate its meaning or construction instructions."
