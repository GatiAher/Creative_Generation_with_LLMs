"Umpire's calls and signaling system"

Explanation:

* Coordination and Regulation: The umpire coordinates and regulates the game by making calls and ensuring that the rules are followed.
* Modular Design: The umpire's signaling system is divided into different signals for different calls, such as strikes, balls, outs, and safe/out calls, allowing for clear and distinct communication.
* Feedback Control: Players, coaches, and fans provide feedback to the umpire, who may adjust their calls based on this feedback, creating a feedback control system.
* Efficient Communication: The umpire's signals are designed to be easily understood and communicated to all players and fans, allowing for efficient communication and coordination during the game.
