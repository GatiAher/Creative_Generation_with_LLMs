  "purpose": "Sound Energy enables the transmission and reception of sound information, allowing for communication and perception of the world through vibrations in a medium. It is the mechanical energy that drives the propagation of sound waves, facilitating long-distance travel without requiring a physical connection between the source and the receiver.",
  "mechanism": "Sound Energy is based on the mathematical principle of wave propagation, where oscillations occur in a medium (like air, water, or a solid material). These oscillations follow a sinusoidal pattern, characterized by specific wavelength, frequency, and amplitude. The wavelength describes the distance between two consecutive points of the same phase in the wave, while frequency indicates how many cycles occur per second. Amplitude refers to the maximum displacement of the medium from its equilibrium position. The product of amplitude and the square of frequency determines the sound energy's intensity, which is directly proportional to the perceived loudness of the sound. Geometrically, sound energy propagation can be represented as concentric spheres expanding from the source, demonstrating the efficient distribution of energy in three-dimensional space."
