"Self-contained micro-reactors for repulsor ray production" could be a feature in the domain of Iron Man that satisfies all the features of the spec. These micro-reactors could be specialized cells that produce repulsor rays, optimized for efficient energy production and regulated through homeostatic mechanisms. Additionally, having multiple micro-reactors could provide redundancy and backup systems, and the modularity and compartmentalization of these cells could prevent issues in one from affecting the others.
