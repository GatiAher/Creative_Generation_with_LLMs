  "purpose": "The purpose of Hydrography on topographic maps is to provide a visual representation of water features and their respective depths, facilitating navigation, resource management, and infrastructure planning.",
  "mechanism": "Hydrography is achieved through the use of specific geometric shapes, mathematical calculations, and engineering techniques. Geometric shapes like lines, polygons, and points are used to depict various water features. Mathematical calculations, such as contour intervals, help represent the terrain's elevation changes around water bodies. Engineering techniques, like depth curve representation, enable the visualization of underwater features and their depths, ensuring comprehensive and accurate topographic maps."
