The extended metaphor highlights the similarities between meteors (or shooting stars) and Iron Man's repulsor blast propulsion in terms of their natural method of transport, friction-based propulsion, size and speed-dependent brightness, and survivability of larger bodies. Both meteors and repulsor blasts rely on friction to generate heat and thrust, allowing for propulsion and movement through their respective mediums. Additionally, the size and intensity of both meteors and repulsor blasts can indicate their size and speed, providing a visible indication of their capabilities. Finally, both meteors and repulsor blasts allow for survivability, whether it's the delivery of extraterrestrial material to a planet's surface or the protection of oneself and others from danger.
