"redshift": "Redshift in big bang theory uses the principle of redshift effect, where the wavelength of light appears to stretch as it moves away from an observer in an expanding universe, shifting it towards longer, redder wavelengths. This helps in estimating the distance and speed of distant galaxies.",
