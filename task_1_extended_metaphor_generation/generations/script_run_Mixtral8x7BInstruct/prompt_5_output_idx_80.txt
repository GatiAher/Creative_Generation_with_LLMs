"Idol Training System"

The Kpop industry's idol training system can be metaphorically related to the given spec as follows:

* Demarcation Point: The training system is a demarcation point that separates trainees from the external world, providing them with rigorous training and shaping their personalities to prepare them for their debut as Kpop idols.
* Extreme Gravitational Forces: The high expectations, pressure, and competition within the training system can be compared to extreme gravitational forces. These forces shape and mold the trainees, pushing them to their limits and helping them grow as artists.
* One-Way Membrane: Once a trainee enters the system, they are committed to the rigorous training and the rules set by the entertainment companies. It is challenging for them to leave or return to the external world, as they are fully immersed in the training process.
* Field Equations: The training system's guidelines, schedules, and rules can be considered as the field equations. They control the interaction between the trainees and the system, dictating how they should behave, practice, and develop their skills to become successful Kpop idols.
