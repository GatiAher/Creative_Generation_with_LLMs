"The Kpop industry's use of a hierarchical agency system"

* Efficient energy distribution and use: The agency system in Kpop can be thought of as a hierarchical system that efficiently distributes and uses resources, such as talent, funding, and marketing, to maximize the potential for growth and success of Kpop idols and groups.
* Modular and self-organizing system: The agency system can be seen as a modular and self-organizing system, where the addition or removal of an agency or group does not necessarily affect the functioning of the other agencies and groups in the industry. This allows for a high degree of resilience and adaptability within the Kpop industry.
* Geometric representation as a pyramid: The agency system can be visualized as a pyramid, with smaller, independent agencies at the base and the larger, more established agencies at the top. This pyramid shape represents the decreasing amount of resources and influence available at each higher level.
