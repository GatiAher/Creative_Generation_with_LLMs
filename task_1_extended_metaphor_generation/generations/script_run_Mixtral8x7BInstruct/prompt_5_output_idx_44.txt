"Harmonized Choreography"

* Justification:
* Harmonized choreography serves as a baseline for measuring uniformity in Kpop performances.
* Light and sound (electromagnetic radiation) are used to enhance the viewing and listening experience, similar to how cosmic microwave background radiation is used in studying the early universe.
* The high degree of symmetry in Kpop choreography helps maintain consistency and synchronization among performers.
* Small variations in choreography and formation can convey different emotions or highlight specific members, similar to temperature and density variations in cosmic microwave background radiation.
* Mathematical tools and engineering techniques are used in creating, practicing, and executing harmonized choreography, such as motion capture, computer-aided design, and statistical analysis of performance metrics.
