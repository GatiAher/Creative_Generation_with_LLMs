The Relativistic Momentum {{serves as an updated concept of momentum}} that takes into account the effects of high speeds on mass and energy, ensuring accurate calculations and predictions in the field of special relativity. This concept is crucial in {{designing systems and models}} and {{models and simulations}} that involve fast-moving objects, particularly in the realms of [[engineering]] and [[space exploration]], and [[high-energy particle physics]]. Relativistic Momentum is calculated as the product of the {{relativistic mass}} and velocity of an object. The {{relativistic mass}} is a modification of the {{classical mass concept}}, which increases as the velocity of an object approaches the speed of light. The {{velocity}} is a vector quantity representing the rate of change of an object's position. The structure of the Relativistic Momentum supports its purpose by accurately accounting for the relationship between mass, energy, and velocity, enabling the creation of precise [[models and simulations]] for high-speed objects.
