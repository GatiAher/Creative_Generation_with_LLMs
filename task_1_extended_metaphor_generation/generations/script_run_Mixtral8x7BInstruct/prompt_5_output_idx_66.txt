"Arc Reactor Technology" could be a feature in the domain of Iron Man that satisfies all the features of the spec. Here's how:

* High Temperatures and Densities: The arc reactor in Iron Man's suit generates a high amount of energy in a small space, creating high temperatures and densities within the reactor core.
* Strong Nuclear Force: The arc reactor's energy generation is based on nuclear reactions, which involve the strong nuclear force holding atomic nuclei together, allowing them to release energy in a controlled manner.
* Nuclear Reaction Physics: The arc reactor's operation is based on the principles of nuclear reaction physics, including the behavior of atomic nuclei under extreme conditions, and the calculation of energy yields from nuclear reactions.
