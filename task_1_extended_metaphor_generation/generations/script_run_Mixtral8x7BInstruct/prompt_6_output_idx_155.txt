"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Digital ledger technology with smart contracts in money have Redundancy (having a backup copy to ensure accurate transmission of information)",
"replication": "In Replication, having two strands of DNA that are complementary to each other ensures accurate transmission of genetic information by providing a backup copy. This redundancy allows for easy identification and correction of any errors that may occur during the replication process.",
"digital\_ledger\_technology\_with\_smart\_contracts": "Similarly, in Digital ledger technology with smart contracts, the use of a distributed ledger provides redundancy by maintaining multiple copies of the same information across a network of computers. This ensures that if one copy is compromised or lost, the information can still be accessed from other copies, providing a high level of data integrity and security."

"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Digital ledger technology with smart contracts in money have Modular Design (using identical modules that can be easily replaced and repaired)",
"replication": "In Replication, the use of identical base pairs and geometric design in the resulting replicated DNA molecules allows for easy replacement and repair of damaged or mutated parts. This modular design ensures that the replication process can continue even if there are issues with a specific section of the DNA molecule.",
"digital\_ledger\_technology\_with\_smart\_contracts": "Likewise, in Digital ledger technology with smart contracts, the use of standardized protocols and interfaces allows for easy integration and replacement of different components within the system. This modular design ensures that the system can continue to function even if one component fails, providing a high level of reliability and scalability."

{
"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Digital ledger technology with smart contracts in money have Standardization (using a standardized mechanism to ensure compatibility and accurate transmission of information)",
"replication": "In Replication, the use of a standardized base pairing mechanism (A-T, C-G) ensures compatibility and accurate transmission of genetic information. This standardization allows for the replication process to occur efficiently and accurately, reducing the chance of errors.",
"digital\_ledger\_technology\_with\_smart\_contracts": "Similarly, in Digital ledger technology with smart contracts, the use of standardized protocols and interfaces ensures compatibility and accurate transmission of information across the network. This standardization allows for seamless integration of different components and ensures that the system functions as intended."

{
"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Digital ledger technology with smart contracts in money have Segregation (separating information to reduce the chance of errors)",
"replication": "In Replication, the separation of the two strands during replication ensures that each new DNA molecule contains only one original strand and one newly synthesized strand, reducing the chance of errors. This segregation ensures that the replication process occurs accurately and efficiently.",
"digital\_ledger\_technology\_with\_smart\_contracts": "Likewise, in Digital ledger technology with smart contracts, the use of cryptographic techniques to segregate and protect sensitive information ensures the integrity and security of the system. This segregation reduces the chance of errors and ensures that the system functions as intended."

"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Digital ledger technology with smart contracts in money have Automation (using automated processes to reduce the chance of human error)",
"replication": "In Replication, the use of enzymes to facilitate the assembly of new strands ensures that the process is automated, reducing the chance of human error. This automation ensures that the replication process occurs efficiently and accurately.",
"digital\_ledger\_technology\_with\_smart\_contracts": "Similarly, in Digital ledger technology with smart contracts, the use of automated processes and algorithms ensures that the system functions efficiently and accurately, reducing the chance of human error."

"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Digital ledger technology with smart contracts in money have Fault Tolerance (using mechanisms to ensure that the system can continue to function even if there are errors)",
"replication": "In Replication, the use of a semi-conservative replication mechanism ensures that the new DNA molecule contains at least one correct strand, reducing the chance of errors and increasing the overall reliability of the system. This fault tolerance ensures that the replication process can continue even if there are issues with a specific section
