"""{{Linear Momentum}} describes the motion of an object in a way that takes into account both its {{mass}} and {{speed}}, providing a measure of its resistance to changes in that motion. This concept is useful in [[engineering]] and [[design]] for predicting how objects will interact with each other and with external forces. {{Linear Momentum}} is defined as the product of an object's {{mass}} and {{velocity}}, both of which are [[vector]] quantities. {{Mass}} is a measure of the amount of matter in an object, while {{velocity}} is a measure of an object's speed and direction. By taking the product of these two quantities, {{Linear Momentum}} captures the combined effect of an object's mass and motion. Because it is a [[vector]] quantity, {{Linear Momentum}} also takes into account the direction of an object's motion, which is important for understanding how forces will affect the object. The conservation of {{Linear Momentum}} in closed systems is a fundamental principle of {{physics}}, and it has important implications for the design of systems in which objects interact with each other, such as in [[mechanical engineering]] or [[architecture]]."""
