"Iconic Group Dynamism"

Explanation:

While there is no direct correlation between Kpop and the complex concepts of black holes, we can create an analogy using the concept of an "Iconic Group Dynamism" to satisfy the given spec.

1. Extreme concentration of mass: Iconic Kpop groups have a massive following and influence, often referred to as "fan armies." This intense concentration of fandom can significantly impact the music industry and popular culture, warping reality in terms of trends and sales.
2. Divergence of spacetime curvature: Iconic Group Dynamism can be seen as a unique curvature in the Kpop industry, causing a shift in the musical landscape and influencing other groups and artists to adapt or evolve.
3. Modeling with solutions to field equations: In the Kpop industry, successful groups like BTS and Blackpink have provided solutions or templates for other aspiring idols and groups to follow, leading to the growth and development of the industry as a whole.
4. Event horizon: Iconic Group Dynamism often creates an event horizon, where the group's immense popularity and influence create a barrier that prevents new artists or trends from directly interacting with or rivaling them, at least initially.

Please note that this analogy is a creative interpretation and not a literal representation of the spec's concepts in the context of Kpop.
