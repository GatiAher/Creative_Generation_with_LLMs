The Rate Law serves as a {\{mathematical\}} tool in the design of chemical reactions, enabling engineers and chemists to predict the effect of reactant concentrations on the speed of a reaction, thereby optimizing yield, reducing unwanted side reactions, and saving time and resources in industrial applications. The Rate Law is expressed as a {\{mathematical function\}} where the rate of reaction is proportional to the concentration of one or more reactants, raised to a power that represents the order of the reaction with respect to that reactant. The {\[overall order\]}} of the reaction is the sum of these powers. By measuring the initial rate of reaction at different reactant concentrations, the rates can be plotted against the concentrations on a {\[logarithmic scale\}}, and the slope of the best-fit line will reveal the order of the reaction and the rate constant.
