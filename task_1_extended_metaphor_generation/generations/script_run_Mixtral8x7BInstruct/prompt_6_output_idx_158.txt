"metaphor": "both Transcription in DNA and Nanotechnology blueprinting in Iron Man have a Blueprint - the use of a master plan (DNA molecule or Iron Man's design blueprint) to create a blueprint (RNA molecule or Iron Man's nano-parts) for the construction of specific structures.",
"transcription": "During Transcription, the DNA molecule serves as a blueprint for the creation of an RNA molecule. The sequence of nucleotide bases in DNA contains the genetic information that is necessary for the synthesis of proteins. The RNA polymerase enzyme moves along the DNA template, unzipping the double helix and mathematically translating the geometric pattern of nucleotide bases into a complementary RNA sequence.",
"nanotechnology\_blueprinting": "Similarly, in Iron Man's suit, the design blueprint contains the necessary information for the construction of the suit's nano-parts. The suit's onboard AI, JARVIS, uses this blueprint to create and assemble the nano-parts, resulting in the final structure of the suit. Just like Transcription, the process is precise and accurate, ensuring that the final structure of the suit matches the original design blueprint."
