"Idol's hormonal response to fan interactions"

Explanation:

* Control system: An idol's hormonal response to fan interactions acts as a control system, constantly monitoring the environment (i.e. the energy and excitement level of the fans) and releasing hormones (e.g. adrenaline) as needed to maintain balance (i.e. to perform at their best).
* Dual structure: The idol's hormonal response has a dual structure, with their body's internal sensors and actuators (e.g. the adrenal glands) allowing them to respond to a wide range of stimuli (e.g. the cheers and screams of the fans) and maintain homeostasis (e.g. by releasing the right amount of hormones to keep their energy levels stable).
* Hormones as control signals: The hormones released by the idol's body (e.g. adrenaline) can be thought of as control signals, which affect the function of various organs and systems (e.g. increasing heart rate, improving focus, and boosting energy levels) to help the idol perform at their best.
* Engineering control system: The structure and function of an idol's hormonal response to fan interactions can be compared to that of an engineering control system, with the input being the environment (i.e. the energy and excitement level of the fans), and the output being the hormones that are released to maintain homeostasis (e.g. by keeping the idol's energy levels stable and helping them perform at their best).
