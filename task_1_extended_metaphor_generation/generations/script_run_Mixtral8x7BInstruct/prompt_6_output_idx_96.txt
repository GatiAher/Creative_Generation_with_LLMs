In this extended metaphor, I have compared Producers in ecosystems and Visual-heavy performances with intricate choreography and stage design, optimized for energy-efficient lighting and visual effects. in Kpop in terms of three design principles and mechanisms. The first design principle is the conversion and storage of energy in a usable form using a primary energy source. Producers in ecosystems, such as plants, use sunlight to convert and store solar energy in a usable form, such as chemical energy, through the process of photosynthesis. Visual-heavy performances with intricate choreography and stage design, optimized for energy-efficient lighting and visual effects. in Kpop use the primary energy source of the audience's attention and engagement to convert and store energy in the form of excitement and enjoyment.

The second design principle is the optimization of energy conversion and storage. Producers, such as plants, use mathematical calculations and geometric arrangements, such as the conversion of light energy into chemical energy, to optimize the efficiency of energy conversion and storage. Visual-heavy performances with intr
