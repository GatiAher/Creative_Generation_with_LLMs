  "purpose": "Isotope geochemistry is a tool for measuring and interpreting the distribution and abundance of isotopes in geological materials, which helps us understand Earth's history and internal processes. It serves as a quantitative method to reveal information about the age, origin, and evolution of geological materials and Earth systems.",
  "mechanism": "Isotope geochemistry is based on the principles of atomic structure, radioactive decay, and mass differences between isotopes. It involves the use of mathematical models, analytical techniques, and engineering tools to measure and analyze isotopic compositions in geological materials. The data obtained from isotopic measurements are then processed using geometric and statistical methods to extract meaningful information. The design of isotope geochemistry experiments and interpretations requires a solid understanding of geochemical processes, nuclear physics, and data analysis techniques."
