"""Potential Energy {{serves as a form of stored energy, enabling the accomplishment of tasks or movement of objects}} without a continuous external power source. It acts as a '{{charge}}' that can be converted into kinetic energy, facilitating motion and work. The structure of Potential Energy is based on the [[concepts of geometry, math, engineering, and design]] through its relationship with [[forces]], position, and configuration. In [[geometric terms]], the change in Potential Energy depends on the spatial arrangement of objects and their distances from each other. Mathematically, it is represented by the equation U = mgh, where U is Potential Energy, m is mass, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and h is height. Engineers and designers utilize this principle to create systems that harness Potential Energy, such as [[dams]], [[elevators]], and weightlifting equipment, by strategically positioning objects or materials to maximize energy storage and efficiency.{{""}"}
