The {{Greenhouse effect}} acts as a natural {\{insulation system\}} for the Earth, regulating the temperature of the planet to support life. It is similar to a <{\{thermal insulation blanket\}}> designed to maintain a desirable temperature range within a system. The Earth's atmosphere is composed of various gases, including {{greenhouse gases}} such as carbon dioxide and methane. These gases allow short-wavelength solar radiation to pass through and reach the Earth's surface, where it gets absorbed and re-emitted as long-wavelength infrared radiation. The greenhouse gases then trap this long-wavelength radiation, preventing it from escaping back into space. This process creates a 'greenhouse' effect, trapping heat in the atmosphere and maintaining the Earth's temperature. The [engineering analogy] would be a selective membrane that only allows certain types of radiation to pass through.
