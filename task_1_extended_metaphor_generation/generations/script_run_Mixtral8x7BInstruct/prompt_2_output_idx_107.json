  "purpose": "The Ionosphere serves as a natural reflector and absorber of high-frequency radio waves, enabling long-distance communication and navigation services. It also shields the Earth's surface from harmful solar radiation.",
  "mechanism": "The Ionosphere is a layered structure within the Earth's atmosphere, with varying densities of charged particles (ions and free electrons) caused by the ionizing effect of solar radiation. The layers, from lower to upper, are D, E, and F. These charged particles interact with high-frequency radio waves, refracting or absorbing them, depending on the wave's frequency. This interaction allows for the bending of radio waves around the curvature of the Earth, facilitating long-distance communications."
