  "purpose": "Distributed databases are designed to increase the reliability, performance, and scalability of data storage systems by distributing data and processing across multiple interconnected computers, in a similar way to how a geographical area might be divided into smaller, more manageable districts for administrative purposes.",
  "mechanism": "At a high level, distributed databases function by partitioning data into smaller chunks called 'shards', which are then distributed across multiple machines, known as nodes. Each node is responsible for managing a portion of the overall data and performing operations on that data. This distributed architecture allows for parallel processing of data, reducing the time required to complete complex queries and operations. Additionally, if one node fails, the system can automatically reroute requests to other nodes, ensuring high availability and fault tolerance."
