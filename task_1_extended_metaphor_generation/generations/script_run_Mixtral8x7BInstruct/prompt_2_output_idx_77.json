  "purpose": "Data Structures serve as a blueprint for organizing and storing data in a way that enables efficient access, modification, and management, much like how a building's architectural design facilitates its functionality and usability.",
  "mechanism": "Data Structures are composed of various mathematical and engineering concepts, such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. These structures have specific rules and relationships between the data elements, similar to geometric shapes and their properties. For example, a stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, resembling the way a stack of plates is arranged, while a tree organizes data in a hierarchical manner, similar to how branches are connected in a tree structure. The choice of Data Structure depends on the specific requirements of the computer program and the type of operations to be performed on the data, similar to how different materials and designs are chosen for building various structures in civil engineering."
