The {{Genome}} serves as the master {{blueprint}} of an {{organism}}, encoding all the necessary information for its growth, development, and function, similar to how a detailed {{engineering design}} contains all the specifications for a complex machine. The {{Genome}} is structured as a double helix of DNA {{molecules}}, resembling a twisted ladder. This [[structure]] allows for the efficient and stable storage of genetic information. The rungs of the ladder, made up of {{nucleotide bases}} , pair up in a specific way (A-T and C-G) forming '{{base pairs}}', which function as the '{{units of information}}}' in the Genome. These base pairs are read in sequences, much like how letters form words and sentences in a language, to create the instructions for building proteins and regulating cellular processes, thereby determining the organism's characteristics and functions.
