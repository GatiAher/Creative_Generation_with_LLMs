"Baseball rulebook"

Explanation:

1. Storage and Transmission Device: The rulebook stores and transmits the rules and regulations of baseball, allowing for the preservation and passing down of the game's structure across generations, similar to how chromosomes store and transmit genetic information.
2. Efficient and Organized Packaging: The rulebook organizes the rules in a clear, concise, and efficient manner, making it easy to access and understand specific rules. This is similar to how chromosomes efficiently package large amounts of genetic information through winding and coiling.
3. Stable Structure: The rulebook provides a stable structure for the game, ensuring consistency in how the game is played, and preventing misinterpretations or changes that could negatively impact the game's integrity. This is similar to how chromosomes provide a stable structure for DNA replication and cell division, ensuring accurate transmission of genetic information.
