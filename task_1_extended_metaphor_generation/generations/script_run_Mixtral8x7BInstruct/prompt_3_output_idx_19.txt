The Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis {{serves}} to uphold the predictability and orderliness of our {{universe}} by postulating that {{singularities}}, when they occur, are always hidden behind {{event horizons}}, thus preventing any direct interaction with the rest of the {{universe}} and any resulting unpredictable or chaotic behavior. The hypothesis is based on the idea that the laws of physics that govern the behavior of matter and energy in the universe, specifically the laws of [[general relativity]] and [[quantum mechanics]], conspire to prevent the formation of [[naked singularities]]. This is achieved by ensuring that any [[singularity]] that may form is always surrounded by a [[event horizon]], a [[boundary]] in spacetime that separates the singularity from the rest of the universe. This event horizon effectively hides the singularity from view and prevents any direct interaction with it, thus preserving the predictability and orderliness of the universe.
