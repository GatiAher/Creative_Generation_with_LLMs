  "purpose": "The creation and transformation of materials, enabling the realization of designed structures and systems in various fields such as engineering, construction, and manufacturing.",
  "mechanism": "Products are the outcome of a chemical reaction, where reactant substances undergo a geometrical rearrangement of their atomic and molecular structure. This process is driven by mathematical principles that govern energy changes and the stability of molecular systems. The resulting Products have distinct properties and behaviors that make them suitable for specific applications, thus playing a crucial role in the design and implementation of various solutions."
