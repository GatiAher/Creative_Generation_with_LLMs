"Biodiversity" is a measure of the complexity and resilience of an "[ecosystem's design](geometry, math, engineering, and design)". It is akin to "redundancy" in "[engineering systems](engineering)", providing multiple ways for an "[ecosystem](biology)" to perform vital functions and recover from "[disturbances](biology)". "[Biodiversity](biology)" is structured like a "[complex](biology), interconnected network](geometry, math, engineering, and design)", with various species and ecosystems fulfilling different roles and functions. This is similar to the concept of a "[design matrix](geometry, math, engineering, and design)" in "[mathematics](geometry, math, engineering, and design)", where each element is connected to and interacts with many others. The variety of species and ecosystems in an area, along with their "[genetic diversity](biology)", allows for multiple pathways for energy and nutrient flow, creating a "[robust](biology) and adaptable system](biology)".
