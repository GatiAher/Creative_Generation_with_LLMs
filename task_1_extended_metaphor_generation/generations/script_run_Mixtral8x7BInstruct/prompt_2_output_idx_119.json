  "purpose": "The map key serves as a decoding tool for users to understand and interpret the visual representations and abstractions of geographical features, distances, and elevations on a topographic map.",
  "mechanism": "The map key employs a systematic organization of geometric symbols, mathematical symbols, engineering lines, and design elements. Each symbol, line, or color is assigned a specific meaning, which correlates to various geographical elements such as buildings, roads, contour lines, or vegetation. This structured design allows users to accurately match visual cues on the map with their real-world counterparts."
