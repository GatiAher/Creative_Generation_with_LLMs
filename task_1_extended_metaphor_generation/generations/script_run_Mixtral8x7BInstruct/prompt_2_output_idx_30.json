  "purpose": "Biodiversity is a measure of the complexity and resilience of an ecosystem's design. It is akin to redundancy in engineering systems, providing multiple ways for an ecosystem to perform vital functions and recover from disturbances.",
  "mechanism": "Biodiversity is structured like a complex, interconnected network, with various species and ecosystems fulfilling different roles and functions. This is similar to the concept of a design matrix in mathematics, where each element is connected to and interacts with many others. The variety of species and ecosystems in an area, along with their genetic diversity, allows for multiple pathways for energy and nutrient flow, creating a robust and adaptable system."
