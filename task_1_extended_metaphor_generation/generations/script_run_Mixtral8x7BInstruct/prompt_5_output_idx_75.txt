"Financial Singularity" - This term represents a hypothetical concept where the concentration of wealth, divergence of financial systems, modeling with complex financial equations, and an event horizon of financial secrecy and privacy create a phenomenon akin to black holes in the realm of money. However, it's important to note that this is a metaphorical interpretation of the spec, as the actual physical properties of black holes cannot be directly applied to the domain of money.
