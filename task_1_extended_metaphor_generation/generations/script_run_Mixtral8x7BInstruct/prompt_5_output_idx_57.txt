"Statistical analysis of player performance trends over distance (e.g. home runs hit by a player over their career) to inform predictions of future performance and player value."

This feature involves proportionality (e.g. the relationship between the number of home runs and the number of at-bats over a player's career), predictive modeling (e.g. using linear regression to model the trend of a player's performance), observation and measurement (e.g. tracking and recording statistics on player performance), and scientific inquiry (e.g. using evidence from observations to inform decisions on player evaluation and roster management).
