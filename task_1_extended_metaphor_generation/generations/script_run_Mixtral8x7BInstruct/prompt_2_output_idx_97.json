  "purpose": "Concurrency control ensures that multiple processes or threads can access and modify shared resources in a distributed system without causing conflicts or inconsistencies, similar to how traffic signals coordinate the movement of vehicles at intersections to prevent collisions.",
  "mechanism": "Concurrency control uses mathematical concepts like vector clocks and consensus algorithms to track the order of operations and ensure agreement among nodes in the system. It also employs engineering principles such as locking and optimistic concurrency control to manage access to shared resources, much like how a designer would use locks on doors to control access to a room. The overall structure of concurrency control is designed to maintain the integrity of the system, similar to how a blueprint for a building ensures that all components fit and function together."
