"Energy-efficient Arc Reactor"

While not a direct correspondence to DNA, the Arc Reactor in Iron Man's suit can be seen as a feature that satisfies the spec in its own domain. The Arc Reactor is a compact, stable, and efficient power source, analogous to the compact, stable, and efficient storage and transmission of information in DNA. Its design is geometrically optimized to fit within the suit and provide efficient energy output. Hydrogen bonds are not explicitly present in the Arc Reactor, but the principle of precise pairing and sequencing can be related to the controlled fusion reaction occurring within the reactor. Lastly, the helical shape of the reactor core in some depictions can be seen as an analogy to the helical structure of DNA, facilitating the manipulation and transport of energy within the suit.
