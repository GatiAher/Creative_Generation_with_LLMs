"Traineeship System"

Explanation:

* Efficient recycling and reuse of resources: The Kpop trainee system often recycles and reuses talented individuals who may not have made it in their initial auditions. These trainees are given further training and development, allowing them to improve and potentially debut in future groups or as solo artists.
* Simplicity and effectiveness: The trainee system breaks down the complex process of becoming an idol into simpler steps, focusing on developing specific skills such as singing, dancing, and acting. This focused approach allows trainees to improve more efficiently.
* Conversion and transformation of raw materials: The raw materials in this case are the trainees who undergo a transformation process to become polished idols. This process includes rigorous training in various areas such as vocals, dance, and performance, as well as personal grooming and image development.
* Resource regeneration and utilization: The trainee system also serves as a means of regenerating and utilizing resources. As trainees improve and debut, they often become mentors or teachers for newer trainees, passing on their knowledge and experience. Additionally, the system allows for the continuous discovery and development of new talent, ensuring a steady supply of resources for the Kpop industry.
