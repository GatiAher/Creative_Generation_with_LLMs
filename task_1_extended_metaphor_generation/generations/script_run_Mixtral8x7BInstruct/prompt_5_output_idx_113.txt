"Successful strategic pitching" could potentially satisfy the features in the spec. Here's how:

* Efficient use and cycling of resources: A pitcher who can throw a variety of pitches (fastball, curveball, slider, changeup, etc.) and locate them effectively can minimize the use of any one pitch, keeping hitters off balance and preventing them from getting comfortable at the plate. This efficient use of pitches can help the pitcher conserve energy and stay effective throughout the game.
* Optimization of resource allocation and waste management: A pitcher who can locate their pitches effectively and change speeds can limit the number of pitches they throw in a given at-bat or inning, reducing the risk of walks or hits and maximizing the effectiveness of each pitch. This optimization of resources can help the pitcher keep their pitch count low and avoid wasting pitches, allowing them to stay in the game longer and give their team a better chance to win.
