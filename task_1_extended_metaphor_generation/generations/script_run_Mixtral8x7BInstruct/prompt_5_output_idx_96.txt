"Visual-heavy performances with intricate choreography and stage design, optimized for energy-efficient lighting and visual effects."

Explanation:

* Conversion and storage of solar energy in a usable form: The use of energy-efficient lighting and visual effects converts and stores solar energy in a usable form for Kpop performances.
* Optimization of energy conversion and storage: The application of mathematical calculations and geometric arrangements in the design of the stage and lighting setup optimizes the efficiency of energy conversion and storage.
* Complex structure for light absorption: The intricate choreography and stage design, which includes reflective and translucent materials, creates a complex structure that enables the absorption of light energy from the stage lighting.
