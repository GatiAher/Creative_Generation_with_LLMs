"Interest rate differentials causing economic strain and deformation of financial systems." This feature describes how differences in interest rates can cause economic stress and lead to the deformation of financial systems, similar to how differential force causes stretching and deformation in the original spec. Just as the curvature of spacetime determines gravitational force, interest rates are a key factor in determining the health and behavior of financial systems.
