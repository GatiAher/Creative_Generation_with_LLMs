To ensure the reliability and resilience of a {{distributed system}} by allowing it to continue functioning despite the failure of individual components, much like how a well-designed [[building]] remains standing even if one of its [[supports]] is damaged. {{Fault tolerance}} in distributed computing is achieved through [[redundancy]], decentralization, and robust communication protocols. [[Redundancy]] involves having multiple copies of data or processes running on different [[nodes]], so that if one node fails, the system can continue to operate using the remaining nodes. Decentralization ensures that there is no single point of failure, as each node in the system shares the workload and communicates with other nodes to maintain consistency. Robust communication protocols are used to detect and recover from failures, such as [[checksums]] to detect data corruption, [[timeouts]] to detect unresponsive nodes, and consensus algorithms to ensure that all nodes agree on the state of the system.
