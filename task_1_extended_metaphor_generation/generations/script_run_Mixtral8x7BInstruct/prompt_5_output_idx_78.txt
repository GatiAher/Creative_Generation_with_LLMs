The Iron Man suit's "Energy Shields" can be seen as a feature that satisfies all the features of the spec. These shields act as a barrier that hides the complex underlying systems and processes of the suit, while also leveraging fundamental laws of physics to generate a protective force field around the suit. This shield creates a buffer zone between the suit and the external environment, preventing direct interaction and maintaining predictability and orderliness for the suit's operation.
