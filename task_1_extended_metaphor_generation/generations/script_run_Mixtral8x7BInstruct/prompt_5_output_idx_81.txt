"Strike Zone"

Explanation:

* Demarcation Point: The strike zone serves as a defined limit or boundary for the batter, separating strikes from balls.
* Extreme Gravitational Forces: While not literal gravitational forces, the concept of the strike zone can create a "gravitational pull" for the batter to swing and make contact with the pitched ball.
* One-Way Membrane: Once a pitched ball enters the strike zone and is not hit by the batter, it cannot return to the external universe (becoming a ball) unless it first exits the zone.
* Field Equations: The strike zone's behavior and dimensions are governed by the rules and mechanics of baseball, represented mathematically by the height, width, and position of the zone.
