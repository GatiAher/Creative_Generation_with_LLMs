    {
      "name": "Linear Momentum",
      "definition": "The product of the mass of an object and its velocity. It is a vector quantity and is conserved in closed systems."
    },
    {
      "name": "Impulse",
      "definition": "The force applied to an object over a period of time, resulting in a change in its momentum. It is calculated as the integral of force over time."
    },
    {
      "name": "Conservation of Momentum",
      "definition": "A fundamental principle of physics that states the total momentum of a closed system remains constant unless acted upon by an external force."
    },
    {
      "name": "Momentum Transfer",
      "definition": "The process of transferring momentum from one object to another through collisions or other interactions. It is an important concept in the study of kinetics."
    },
    {
      "name": "Relativistic Momentum",
      "definition": "A modification of the classical momentum concept to account for the effects of special relativity. It is calculated as the product of the relativistic mass and velocity of an object."
