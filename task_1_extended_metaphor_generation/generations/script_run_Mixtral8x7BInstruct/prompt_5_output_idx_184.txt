"Choreography Synchronization"

* Geometric Precision: Kpop group dances often involve complex and synchronized movements, requiring a high level of geometric precision.
* Sensitivity to Light: The dances are choreographed to respond to lighting changes during performances, creating a visually stimulating experience.
* Efficient Communication: Group members must efficiently communicate and coordinate to maintain synchronization during performances.
* Hormone Secretion and Transportation: The high energy and excitement generated from the performances release adrenaline, a hormone that stimulates the body, creating an energetic atmosphere.
