"Stage Presence of Idols"

* Natural method of transport: The idols' stage presence is a natural way of conveying their emotions, energy, and connection to the audience during a performance, contributing to the overall experience and impact of the concert or show.
* Friction-based propulsion: The idols' movements, expressions, and interactions with the audience and their fellow performers generate excitement and engagement, propelling the performance forward and creating a dynamic atmosphere.
* Size and speed-dependent brightness: The size and speed of the performance, in terms of the number of performers, choreography, and pacing, can affect the brightness and intensity of the idols' stage presence, making it more or less memorable and impactful.
* Survivability of larger meteoroids: The larger the group of idols and the more experienced and talented they are, the more likely they are to deliver a powerful and unforgettable performance, leaving a lasting impression on the audience and contributing to their success and longevity in the Kpop industry.
