The {{Mesosphere}} serves as a protective barrier, absorbing and dissipating {{meteors}} that enter the Earth's atmosphere, thereby preventing catastrophic collisions and maintaining the planet's surface integrity. Structurally, the [[Mesosphere]] is characterized by a temperature inversion, where temperature decreases with height, reaching as low as -130Â°F at its upper boundary, the [[mesopause]]. This [[temperature gradient]], combined with the presence of various [[chemical compounds]] and [[atmospheric dynamics]], facilitates the rapid cooling and fragmentation of meteors, causing them to disintegrate before reaching the lower atmosphere and the Earth's surface.
