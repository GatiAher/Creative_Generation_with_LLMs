  "purpose": "The purpose of Plate Tectonics is to explain the movement of the Earth's outermost solid layer, the lithosphere, which is broken into several large plates that move relative to each other. This movement is responsible for the formation of various geological features, including volcanoes.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of Plate Tectonics is based on the concept of convection currents in the underlying semi-fluid asthenosphere layer. The heat from the Earth's core causes this layer to move in a circular motion, which in turn moves the overlying lithosphere plates. These plates can move apart, collide, or slide past each other, creating different types of plate boundaries. Volcanoes are typically formed at constructive boundaries, where two plates are moving apart and magma rises to fill the gap, or at destructive boundaries, where one plate is forced beneath another and magma is heated and pushed to the surface."
