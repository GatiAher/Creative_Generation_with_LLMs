"Fractional-reserve banking system with automatic interest rate adjustment"

Explanation:

1. Feedback Loops: The central bank monitors economic indicators, such as inflation and employment rates, and adjusts interest rates accordingly to maintain monetary stability.

2. Emergent Properties: The complex and unpredictable behavior of the economy arises from the interactions of various market participants, including banks, businesses, and consumers.

3. System Optimization: The fractional-reserve banking system is designed to optimize the use of financial resources by allowing banks to lend out a portion of their deposits, thereby increasing the money supply and facilitating economic growth.

4. Mathematical System Redundancy: The fractional-reserve system includes redundancies in the form of reserve requirements, which require banks to hold a certain percentage of their deposits in reserve, ensuring that there is always a backup supply of funds available in the system.

5. Geometric Arrangement: The fractional-reserve system is geometrically arranged in a hierarchical structure, with central banks at the top and commercial banks at the bottom, allowing for efficient and effective regulation and oversight of the financial system.
