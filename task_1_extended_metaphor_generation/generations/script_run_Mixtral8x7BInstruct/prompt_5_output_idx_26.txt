"Iron Man's Solar-Powered Space Debris Net"

This feature includes specialized components that capture and remove space debris, collecting data about the debris for scientific insights. The net and its components are designed to withstand the harsh conditions of space, such as high-speed motion, friction, and heat generation during entry into a planet's atmosphere. The system analyzes the forces acting upon meteoroids and incorporates countermeasures and protective designs. Additionally, the materials selected for the net ensure durability and optimal performance in the space environment.
