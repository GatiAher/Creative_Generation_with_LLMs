"Iron Man's suit control system" could be a feature that satisfies all the features of the spec. The suit's control system constantly monitors the external environment and the wearer's internal biometrics, releasing corrective actions (e.g., adjusting the suit's thrusters, deploying countermeasures) as needed to maintain balance and homeostasis for the wearer. The suit's structure, with its various sensors and actuators, allows it to respond to a wide range of stimuli and maintain homeostasis through the release of specific responses. The suit's control signals (e.g., commands sent to the thrusters, activation of the suit's various systems) travel through the suit and affect the function of various components and subsystems, similar to how hormones produced by the adrenal glands affect the function of various organs and systems in the human body.
