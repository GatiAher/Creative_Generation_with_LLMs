  "purpose": "The purpose of Redshift is to serve as evidence for the Big Bang Theory, specifically the universe's expansion. It provides a way to measure this expansion and estimate the time elapsed since the Big Bang.",
  "mechanism": "Redshift operates based on the Doppler Effect, a concept from geometry and physics. As light moves away from an observer in an expanding universe, its wavelength appears to stretch, shifting it towards longer, redder wavelengths. This is due to the relative motion between the light source and the observer. The greater the distance and the faster the expansion, the more pronounced the redshift effect. By measuring the redshift of distant galaxies, scientists can determine their speed and distance, providing valuable insights into the history and evolution of the universe."
