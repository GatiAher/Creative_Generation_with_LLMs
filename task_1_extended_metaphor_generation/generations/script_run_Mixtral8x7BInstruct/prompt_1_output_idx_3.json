      "name": "Biotic factors",
      "definition": "The living components of an ecosystem, including plants, animals, and microorganisms, that interact with one another and their non-living environment."

    {
      "name": "Producers",
      "definition": "Organisms, typically photosynthetic plants and algae, that convert energy from the sun into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis."
    },
    {
      "name": "Consumers",
      "definition": "Organisms that consume other organisms for energy and nutrients, classified as herbivores (plant-eaters), carnivores (meat-eaters), and omnivores (eating both plants and animals)."

      "name": "Decomposers",
      "definition": "Organisms, such as fungi and bacteria, that break down dead organic material and waste, recycling essential nutrients back into the ecosystem."
    },
    {
      "name": "Trophic levels",
      "definition": "The feeding levels in an ecosystem, starting with producers at the bottom and progressing to herbivores, carnivores, and decomposers."

    {
      "name": "Food chains",
      "definition": "A linear sequence of organisms in an ecosystem, where each organism consumes the one below it, starting with producers and ending with top carnivores."

      "name": "Food webs",
      "definition": "A complex network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem, showing the feeding relationships between various organisms."
    },

      "name": "Biodiversity",
      "definition": "The variety of life in an ecosystem, including the number of different species, their genetic diversity, and the variety of ecosystems themselves."
