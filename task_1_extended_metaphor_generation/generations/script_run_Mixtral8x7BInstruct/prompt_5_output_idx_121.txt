"The baseball lineup and batting order"

Explanation:

Redundancy: A baseball team's lineup has multiple players with different skills and abilities, providing various ways for the team to score runs. If one player is not performing well, the team can still rely on others to get on base, steal, or hit home runs.

Interconnected network: The batting order connects each player to and interacts with many others. The outcome of each at-bat affects the next batter's situation, creating multiple pathways for runs to score.

Design matrix: The lineup and batting order create a structure where each player is connected to and interacts with many others. The manager can adjust the lineup to optimize for different opponents, park effects, and game situations, allowing for robustness and adaptability.

Complex system: The baseball lineup consists of various components (players) fulfilling different roles (leadoff, power hitter, RBI, etc.). This structure leads to a robust and adaptable system, as the team can respond to changing game situations and adjust its strategy accordingly.
