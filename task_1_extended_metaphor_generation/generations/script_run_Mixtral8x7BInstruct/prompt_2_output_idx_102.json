  "purpose": "The Remote Procedure Call (RPC) serves as a bridge connecting separate entities in a distributed system, enabling them to communicate and collaborate as if they were part of a unified whole. This mechanism simplifies the process of requesting services or data from remote units, making the interaction experience similar to invoking local functions. Consequently, it enhances the transparency of distributed systems, thereby improving their ease of use, efficiency, and adaptability in various fields such as geometry, math, engineering, and design.",
  "mechanism": "RPC functions by allowing a client to make a procedure call as if it were accessing a local resource, while the actual execution occurs on a remote server. The client sends a message requesting the execution of a specific procedure, along with any necessary parameters. Upon receiving the request, the server processes the call, generates a response, and sends it back to the client. The client then receives the response and continues its execution as if the procedure had been executed locally. This mechanism abstracts the complexities of network communication, providing a simple and intuitive interface for clients and servers to interact, thus facilitating the development and integration of distributed systems across various domains, including geometry, math, engineering, and design."
