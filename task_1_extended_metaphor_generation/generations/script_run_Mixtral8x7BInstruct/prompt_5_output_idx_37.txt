"Optimized placement of baseball teams in a league"

Explanation:

* "Stable Orbit": Just as celestial bodies maintain a stable orbit around a central body, optimized placement of teams in a league ensures stability by minimizing travel distance and time, reducing costs, and promoting fairness.
* "Flat Structure": A league is organized in a flat, linear structure with a clear hierarchy, similar to a disk-like structure in a solar system. This allows for easy scheduling and competition.
* "Temperature Control": The placement of teams in a league can regulate the intensity and competitiveness of the league, similar to how temperature is regulated in a solar system. This ensures that the league remains challenging but not overwhelming for any one team.
* "Gravitational Perturbations": The movement of teams within a league, whether through trades, free agency, or other means, can create gravitational perturbations, similar to those caused by nearby objects in a solar system. These perturbations can lead to changes in a team's trajectory, potentially resulting in improved performance and success.
