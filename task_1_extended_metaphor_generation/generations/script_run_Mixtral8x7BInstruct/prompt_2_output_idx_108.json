  "purpose": "The Exosphere is the final buffer zone of Earth's atmosphere, providing a protective barrier against harmful solar radiation and cosmic debris while also facilitating the gradual transition of Earth's atmospheric gases into the vacuum of outer space.",
  "mechanism": "The Exosphere's structure is characterized by its extremely low density, extending from the top of the thermosphere to approximately 10,000 km above Earth's surface. This layer is composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and heavy ions, which slowly move in ballistic trajectories due to the weak gravity at such high altitudes. This structure allows the Exosphere to act as a transitional region, gradually thinning out and merging with outer space, thereby protecting Earth from direct exposure to harmful cosmic radiation and debris."
