A chemical reaction is like a currency exchange. The reactants, or the substances that undergo the reaction, are like the foreign currency that you bring to the exchange counter. Just as you have a certain amount of foreign currency, you have a certain number of moles of each reactant. The value of the foreign currency may fluctuate with the market, but the number of moles of reactants remains constant, unless they are allowed to react with each other.

Reactants, like foreign currency, can be combined in different ratios to produce a desired result. In a chemical reaction, the ratio of reactants is determined by the stoichiometry of the reaction, which is the relative number of moles of each reactant needed to complete the reaction. Similarly, the exchange rate between two currencies determines how much of one currency is needed to obtain a certain amount of the other.

Reactants, like foreign currency, can be converted into other forms. In a chemical reaction, reactants can be transformed into products, which are the substances that are formed as a result of the reaction. Similarly, foreign currency can be converted into the local currency, or into other forms of currency.

Reactants, like foreign currency, can be saved for later use. In a chemical reaction, reactants can be stored in a stable form until they are needed. Similarly, foreign currency can be kept in a safe place until it is needed for a future transaction.

Reactants, like foreign currency, can be exchanged for other substances. In a chemical reaction, reactants can be combined with other substances to form new compounds. Similarly, foreign currency can be exchanged for other currencies or for goods and services.

Overall, reactants in a chemical reaction are like foreign currency in a currency exchange. They can be combined, transformed, saved, and exchanged in various ways, depending on the needs and goals of the participant.
