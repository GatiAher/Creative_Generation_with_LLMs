The balancing of {{chemical equations}} is a {{problem-solving activity}} that aims to maintain {{equivalence}} and ensure {{conservation of matter}} throughout a {{chemical reaction}}, similar to how an {{engineer}} would ensure that {{resources}} are efficiently {{allocated}} and no {{material}} is wasted in a {{design plan}}. The mechanism of balancing {{chemical equations}} involves the use of {{mathematical principles}} and the assignment of {{coefficients}} to {{reactant}} and {{product species}} to ensure that the number of {{atoms}} of each {{element}} is equal on both sides of the equation, much like how {{geometric proportions}} are used to maintain {{balance}} and {{symmetry}} in {{design}}.
