The {{Transition State}} is a concept in {{chemical kinetics}} that serves as a bridge between the initial state of {{reactants}} and the final state of {{products}}, facilitating the understanding of reaction rates and energy barriers in a {{chemical reaction}}. The {{Transition State}} is characterized by a unique [geometry], often described as a saddle point on the potential energy surface of the reaction. This [geometry] represents the point of maximum energy that the system must overcome to proceed from {{reactants}} to {{products}}. The [[math]] behind this concept involves the calculation of activation energies and rate constants, which are used to describe the kinetics of the reaction. In terms of [engineering] and [design], the {{Transition State}} can be thought of as a 'checkpoint' in the reaction process, where the system must surpass a certain energy [[threshold]] to continue on to the {{product}} state.
