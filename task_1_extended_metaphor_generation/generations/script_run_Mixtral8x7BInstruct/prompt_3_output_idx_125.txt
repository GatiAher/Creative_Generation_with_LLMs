"""Polar Stratospheric Clouds ({{PSCs}}) serve as a platform for chemical reactions that result in the depletion of the ozone layer in the {{polar regions}}. These clouds provide a surface for {{chlorine-containing gases}} to accumulate and interact with ozone molecules, leading to the conversion of chlorine into forms that are more reactive towards ozone. PSCs form in the extreme cold temperatures of the {{polar vortex}}, a large-scale [[cyclone]] that circulates in the stratosphere. The polar vortex creates a region of cold, dense air that is conducive to the formation of PSCs. These clouds are composed of {{water droplets}} or {{nitric acid hydrates}}, which provide a surface for chlorine-containing gases such as {{hydrochloric acid}} and {{chlorine nitrate}} to accumulate. When exposed to [[sunlight]], these gases are converted into reactive forms of chlorine, such as {{chlorine monoxide}} and {{dichlorine radicals}}, which can then react with ozone molecules and deplete the ozone layer. The structure of PSCs, therefore, supports their role in ozone depletion by providing a surface for chlorine-containing gases to accumulate and react with ozone molecules."""
