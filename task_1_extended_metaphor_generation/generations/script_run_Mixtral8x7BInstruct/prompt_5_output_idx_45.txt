The "symmetry" of strike zones in baseball can be compared to the high degree of symmetry in the early universe. Umpires aim for consistency in calling strikes, creating a uniform "strike zone" for each batter. However, slight variations or "deviations" in the strike zone (similar to those in the cosmic microwave background radiation) can provide valuable information about the umpire's performance, pitcher's skill, or batter's technique. Advanced statistical analysis (similar to mathematical tools and engineering techniques used in cosmology) can be applied to measure these variations and enhance the game's understanding.
