The purpose of {"Momentum Transfer" / Physics} is to describe how the motion of an object is affected when it collides or interacts with another object. It helps us understand and predict the resulting motion and behavior of both objects. {"Momentum Transfer" / Physics} is based on the principle of conservation of {"momentum" / Physics}, which states that the total {"momentum" / Physics} of a closed system remains constant before and after an interaction. This is because the {"momentum" / Physics} lost by one object is gained by the other. The mechanism of {"Momentum Transfer" / Physics} can be explained using mathematical equations, such as the ["impulse-momentum theorem" / Physics], and [geometrical / geometry] representations, such as {"vector diagrams" / math}, to illustrate the direction and magnitude of {"momentum transfer" / Physics} in different scenarios. The concept is applied in various ["engineering" / engineering] and ["design" / design] fields, such as {"vehicle crash safety" / engineering}, {"sports equipment design" / design}, and {"fluid dynamics" / physics}, to optimize performance and safety.
