  "purpose": "The Asthenosphere provides a cushioning and lubricating layer that facilitates the movement of tectonic plates, enabling the process of plate tectonics.",
  "mechanism": "The Asthenosphere, located beneath the rigid lithosphere, is characterized by its semi-fluid state, which is a result of high temperatures and pressures. This layer exhibits properties similar to a highly viscous liquid, allowing it to flow slowly over time. The plates 'float' on this layer, reducing friction and enabling the plates to move and shift, sometimes converging, diverging, or sliding past each other. This movement results in the formation and movement of continents, the creation of volcanic activity, and the development of earthquakes."
