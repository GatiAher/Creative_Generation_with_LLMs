To create a stable compound by neutralizing the electrical charge of two {{ions}} through the attraction of opposite charges, similar to how magnetic materials with opposite {{poles}} are attracted to each other. {{Ionic bonding}} occurs when one {{atom}} (usually a {{metal}}) transfers an {{electron}} to another atom (usually a non-metal) to fill its outer shell, forming a positively charged ion ({{cation}}) and a negatively charged ion ({{anion}}). These ions, which are {[geometrically]} arranged in a way that maximizes their attractive forces and minimizes repulsive forces, are then held together by electrostatic forces, creating a solid ionic compound. The {[geometry]} of ionic bonding is often described using mathematical terms and models, such as {{crystal lattice structures}} and Madelung constants, which help to predict the physical and chemical properties of the resulting compound.
