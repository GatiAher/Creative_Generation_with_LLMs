  "purpose": "To release pressure and heat from within the Earth, while also shaping the landscape and creating new landforms.",
  "mechanism": "Lava is a fluid-like substance with high temperature and viscosity, which allows it to flow and take on various shapes as it cools and solidifies. Its behavior can be described using mathematical equations of fluid dynamics, and its mechanical properties such as viscosity and density are determined by the composition of the magma from which it originates. Engineers and designers use this knowledge to model and predict lava flow patterns, and to design structures and infrastructure that can withstand their impact."
