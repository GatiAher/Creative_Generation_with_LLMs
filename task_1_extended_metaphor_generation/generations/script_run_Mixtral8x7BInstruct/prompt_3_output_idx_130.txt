The purpose of {{{magma}}} is to act as a conduit for heat transfer from the Earth's {{mantle}} to its {{crust}}, and to facilitate the movement of materials within the Earth's interior. It also plays a critical role in the formation of new crust and the recycling of the existing one. {{{Magma}}} is a highly viscous fluid that is able to flow and deform due to its high temperature and pressure. Its structure is composed of a matrix of crystals suspended in a melt of silicate rocks. The crystals and melt have different properties, such as density and viscosity, which create complex interactions and behaviors within the {{{magma}}}}. These properties, along with the forces acting on the {{{magma}}} (such as gravity and buoyancy), determine how the {{{magma}}} will flow and where it will go. The movement of {{{magma}}} can lead to the formation of volcanoes and the creation of new landforms on the Earth's surface.
