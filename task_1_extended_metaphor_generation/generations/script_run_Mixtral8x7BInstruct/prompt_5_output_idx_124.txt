"Choreography Synchronization"

Explanation:

* Feedback Loops: Dancers continuously monitor and adjust their movements to stay in sync with the group and the music, creating a stable performance.
* Emergent Properties: The complex and visually striking formations and movements that emerge from the interactions of individual dancers.
* System Optimization: Careful rehearsal and practice to optimize the group's movements for maximum visual impact and efficiency.
* Mathematical System Redundancy: Multiple dancers performing the same movements, providing backup in case of mistakes and increasing the overall stability of the performance.
* Geometric Arrangement: Deliberate positioning of dancers in formations that optimize their visual impact and the overall performance.
