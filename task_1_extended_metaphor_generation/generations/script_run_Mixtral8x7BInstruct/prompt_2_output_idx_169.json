  "purpose": "The Heterotic String Theory aims to reconcile two different types of strings, open and closed, within a single framework while maintaining only one supersymmetry. This unification provides a more comprehensive and coherent model of the universe, enabling a balance between the mathematical consistency of string theory and the physical requirement of supersymmetry.",
  "mechanism": "The Heterotic String Theory combines two types of string theories, specifically the Type II superstring theory and the bosonic string theory. The Type II theory contributes closed strings, which have no ends and move in continuous loops, while the bosonic theory provides open strings, which have ends that can attach to surfaces or other strings.To balance the differences between the two parent theories, the Heterotic String Theory introduces an ingenious solution: it utilizes a 16-dimensional compactified lattice, known as the 'E8 x E8' lattice. This lattice effectively cancels out the extra 16 dimensions required by the bosonic theory, thus maintaining the total of 10 dimensions expected in string theory.The 'E8 x E8' lattice comprises two separate E8 lattices, each with 8 dimensions. These lattices contain specific configurations of points and geometric structures, which accommodate the degrees of freedom necessary for the open strings to end. The closed strings, on the other hand, continue to propagate in the remaining 10 dimensions, interacting with the open strings at their endpoints.The Heterotic String Theory's unique structure, combining both open and closed strings with the 'E8 x E8' lattice, allows for the preservation of one supersymmetry. This symmetry ensures that every boson (force carrier) has a corresponding fermion (matter particle), maintaining stability in the universe and simplifying the complexity of the overall superstring theory."
