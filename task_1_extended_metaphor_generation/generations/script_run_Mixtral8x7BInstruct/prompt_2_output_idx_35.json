  "purpose": "The Nitrogenous Bases are the fundamental units of genetic instruction, akin to a blueprint or a set of design specifications, enabling the precise replication and construction of biological organisms.",
  "mechanism": "These bases, specifically Adenine, Thymine, Guanine, and Cytosine, are structured as planar, organic molecules with nitrogen-containing rings. They bond in pairs - Adenine with Thymine and Guanine with Cytosine - through hydrogen bonds, forming a ladder-like structure known as the DNA double helix. This helical structure, stabilized by sugar-phosphate backbones on the outside, allows for the faithful duplication of genetic information during cell division, as well as the transcription of genetic codes into messenger RNA for protein synthesis."
