"metaphor": "both Inflationary Universe in big bang theory and Compound interest in money utilize Identification and Addressing of Issues as a foundational principle",
"inflationary\_universe": "The theory of cosmic inflation addresses issues such as the horizon problem and flatness problem in the early universe, effectively smoothing out any wrinkles in the universe's initial conditions and leading to a more uniform and consistent cosmos.",
"compound\_interest": "Similarly, compound interest addresses the issue of stagnant growth in a financial system by continuously reinvesting interest earned, leading to exponential growth in the total amount of money over time. This allows for a more robust and dynamic financial system."

{
"metaphor": "both Inflationary Universe in big bang theory and Compound interest in money utilize a Driving Force to fuel their respective processes",
"inflationary\_universe": "A negative-pressure vacuum energy density, or dark energy, drives the rapid, accelerated expansion of the universe during the period of inflation, leading to the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe.",
"compound\_interest": "In the same way, the driving force behind compound interest is the continuous reinvestment of interest earned, which leads to a snowballing effect where the total amount of money grows at an increasingly rapid pace."

{
"metaphor": "both Inflationary Universe in big bang theory and Compound interest in money utilize Exponential Growth to achieve their goals",
"inflationary\_universe": "During the period of inflation, the scale factor increases exponentially with time, leading to rapid inflation of the universe and the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe.",
"compound\_interest": "Exponential growth is also a key feature of compound interest, where the total amount of money grows at an increasingly rapid pace due to the continuous reinvestment of interest earned. This leads to a snowballing effect where the total amount of money grows at an exponential rate over time."

{
"metaphor": "both Inflationary Universe in big bang theory and Compound interest in money utilize Preservation of Symmetry to ensure consistency and uniformity",
"inflationary\_universe": "The homogeneity and isotropy of the universe are preserved during the period of inflation, leading to the uniformity of the cosmic microwave background radiation and the large-scale structure of the universe.",
"compound\_interest": "Similarly, compound interest preserves symmetry by ensuring that the interest earned is reinvested at a consistent and uniform rate, leading to a consistent and predictable growth in the total amount of money over time."
