The {{Thermosphere}} serves as a protective barrier, absorbing and scattering solar radiation, while also providing a medium for satellite communication due to its ionized particles. The Thermosphere is a [[spherical shell]] surrounding the Earth, with a radial distance ranging from approximately 80km to 600km above the surface. Its temperature increases with height due to the absorption of intense ultraviolet and X-ray radiation from the sun, causing ionization of gas molecules. This layer's structure [supports its purpose](geometry) by allowing for the reflection of radio waves off the ionosphere, enabling long-distance communication.
