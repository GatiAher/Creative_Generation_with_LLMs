The {{Operating Systems}} serves as the foundation and manager of a computer's resources, similar to how a {{blueprint}} guides the construction of a building. It optimizes the utilization of hardware components and ensures smooth communication between different software applications, much like how a [[geometric framework]] evenly distributes stress in an engineering design. The {{Operating Systems}} functions through a modular and hierarchical structure, akin to a mathematical function or a layered [[engineering system]]. The kernel, its central component, manages hardware resources and provides basic services to other software. User space, the outer layer, contains application software and user-level system software. The {{Operating Systems}} interacts with hardware and software through well-defined interfaces, enabling efficient and organized management of computer resources, comparable to how precise design specifications facilitate collaboration and productivity in a [[geometry]] or [[engineering]] context.
