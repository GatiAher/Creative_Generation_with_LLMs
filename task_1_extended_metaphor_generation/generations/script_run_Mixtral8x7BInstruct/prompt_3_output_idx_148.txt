Isotope tracers serve as a tool to track and analyze the movement and transformation of elements within systems, enabling the study of processes and mechanisms that would otherwise be difficult to observe. Isotope tracers utilize the unique properties of {{isotopes}}, specifically their varying mass and radioactive decay rates. By introducing a specific {{isotope}} into a system, scientists can monitor its movement and transformation through {{mathematical models}} and comparisons of isotope ratios. The principles of [geometry] and [design] come into play as the tracers' spatial distribution and movement patterns are analyzed, while [engineering] concepts are applied to interpret the data and draw conclusions about the system's properties and processes.
