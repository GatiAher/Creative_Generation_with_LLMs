The Exosphere is the final buffer zone of Earth's {{geography: atmosphere}}, providing a protective barrier against harmful {{chemistry: solar radiation}} and cosmic debris while also facilitating the gradual transition of Earth's atmospheric gases into the vacuum of outer space. The Exosphere's [[geometry: structure]] is characterized by its extremely low density, extending from the top of the [[engineering: thermosphere]] to approximately 10,000 km above Earth's surface. This layer is composed primarily of hydrogen, helium, and heavy ions, which slowly move in [[math: ballistic trajectories]] due to the weak [[physics: gravity]] at such high altitudes. This [[engineering: structure]] allows the Exosphere to act as a transitional region, gradually thinning out and merging with outer space, thereby protecting Earth from direct exposure to harmful cosmic radiation and debris.
