"The {{Law of Conservation of Mass}} is a fundamental principle in {{science}} and [[engineering]] that ensures the stability and continuity of mass in any given system, particularly during {{chemical reactions}}. It serves as a [[design constraint]], guaranteeing that the total mass of reactants will always equal the total mass of products, thereby preventing the anomalous creation or disappearance of mass. The mechanism of the {{Law of Conservation of Mass}} can be understood through the lens of {{geometry}} and math. In a geometric representation, the mass of the reactants and products can be visualized as {{volumes}} or quantities. The Law dictates that these volumes remain constant before and after a chemical reaction, thus forming a closed system in the field of geometry. In terms of math, the Law can be expressed as an equation, where the mass of reactants ({{input}}) equals the mass of products ({{output}}}). This equation holds true for any chemical reaction, making it a universal principle in engineering and design. The Law's mathematical structure also allows for predictability and quantifiability of chemical reactions, enabling the design and optimization of various industrial processes."
