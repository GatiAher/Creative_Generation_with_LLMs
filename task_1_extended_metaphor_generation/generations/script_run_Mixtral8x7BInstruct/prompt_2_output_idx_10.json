  "purpose": "The Oort Cloud serves as a protective shell for the solar system, shielding it from external threats such as interstellar objects and cosmic radiation by acting as a sacrificial barrier and absorbent layer.",
  "mechanism": "The Oort Cloud is a theoretical spherical formation of icy bodies, with its radius extending up to 100,000 AU from the Sun. Its geometric shape and large radius create a vast protective zone, dissipating and deflecting external threats before they reach the inner solar system where planets, including Earth, reside. The icy bodies within the Oort Cloud, through their collective gravitational forces, can also attract and capture incoming objects, further enhancing the protective function of this structure."
