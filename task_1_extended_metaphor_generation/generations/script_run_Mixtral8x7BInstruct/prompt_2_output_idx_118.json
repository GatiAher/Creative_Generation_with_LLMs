  "purpose": "The grid system serves as a precise positioning and measurement tool on topographic maps, enabling users to determine and communicate the exact location of features or events with mathematical precision, without dependence on geographic terms.",
  "mechanism": "The grid system is formed by a set of evenly spaced, perpendicular lines that divide the map into uniform squares or rectangles, each representing a unique set of coordinates. These lines, often numbered, facilitate the conversion of geographic positions into mathematical coordinates, allowing for accurate measurements, navigation, and spatial analysis."
