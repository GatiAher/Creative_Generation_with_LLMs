  "purpose": "The Convergent Boundary serves as a point of collision and interaction between two tectonic plates, leading to the formation of topographical features and geological phenomena that can impact the Earth's surface and atmosphere.",
  "mechanism": "Two tectonic plates, moving in opposite directions, collide at the Convergent Boundary, creating immense pressure and friction. Depending on the type of plates involved (continental or oceanic), one plate may be forced beneath the other in a process called subduction. This results in the release of energy, which can lead to the formation of volcanoes and earthquakes. Additionally, the collision of the plates can result in the uplift of the Earth's crust, leading to the creation of mountain ranges. The Convergent Boundary is characterized by its converging geometry, which drives the mechanical processes that result in these geological events."
