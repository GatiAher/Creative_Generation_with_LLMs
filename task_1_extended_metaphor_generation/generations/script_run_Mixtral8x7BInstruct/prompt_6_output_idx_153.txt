"extended\_metaphor": \[
{
"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Rotating pitchers' roles (starting, relief, closing) in baseball have Redundancy (having two copies of genetic information or two pitchers available to throw)",
"replication": "Replication in DNA involves creating two identical strands of genetic information, providing a backup copy to ensure accurate transmission of genetic information.",
"rotating\_pitchers'\_roles\_(starting,\_relief,\_closing)": "Rotating pitchers' roles in baseball involve having multiple pitchers available to throw, ensuring that there is always a fresh arm ready to take the mound and prevent fatigue-related errors."

"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Rotating pitchers' roles (starting, relief, closing) in baseball have Modular Design (using identical base pairs or pitching styles to allow for easy replacement and repair)",
"replication": "Replication in DNA uses identical base pairs and geometric design in the resulting replicated DNA molecules, allowing for easy replacement and repair of damaged or mutated parts.",
"rotating\_pitchers'\_roles\_(starting,\_relief,\_closing)": "Rotating pitchers' roles in baseball use identical pitching styles and techniques, allowing for easy replacement and repair of tired or ineffective pitchers."

{
"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Rotating pitchers' roles (starting, relief, closing) in baseball have Standardization (using a standardized base pairing mechanism or pitching rules)",
"replication": "Replication in DNA uses a standardized base pairing mechanism (A-T, C-G) to ensure compatibility and accurate transmission of genetic information.",

{
"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Rotating pitchers' roles (starting, relief, closing) in baseball have Segregation (separating the two strands or pitchers to reduce the chance of errors)",
"replication": "The separation of the two strands during Replication ensures that each new DNA molecule contains only one original strand and one newly synthesized strand, reducing the chance of errors.",
"rotating\_pitchers'\_roles\_(starting,\_relief,\_closing)": "Rotating pitchers' roles in baseball separates the starting pitcher from the relief pitchers, ensuring that each pitcher is well-rested and less prone to errors."

{
"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Rotating pitchers' roles (starting, relief, closing) in baseball have Automation (using enzymes or technology to facilitate the process)",
"replication": "The use of enzymes in Replication ensures that the process is automated, reducing the chance of human error.",
"rotating\_pitchers'\_roles\_(starting,\_relief,\_closing)": "The use of technology in baseball, such as pitching machines and electronic strike zones, ensures that the process of pitching is automated, reducing the chance of human error."
},
{
"metaphor": "both Replication in DNA and Rotating pitchers' roles (starting, relief, closing) in baseball have Fault Tolerance (using a semi-conservative replication mechanism or rotating pitchers to ensure accuracy)",
"replication": "The use of a semi-conservative replication mechanism in Replication ensures that the new DNA molecule contains at least one correct strand, reducing the chance of errors and increasing the overall reliability of the system.",
"rotating\_pitchers'\_roles\_(starting,\_relief,\_closing)": "Rotating pitchers' roles in baseball uses a system of starting, relief, and closing pitchers to ensure that at least one pitcher is well-rested and accurate, reducing the chance of errors and increasing the overall reliability of the pitching staff."
