The Conservation of Momentum serves as a predictive tool in {{engineering}} and {{design}}, allowing professionals to anticipate how the motion of a system will change over time, and to create solutions that maintain stability and safety. The mechanism of the Conservation of Momentum is rooted in [geometry], [math], and {{physics}}. It states that the vector sum of the momenta of all the objects in a closed system remains constant, unless acted upon by an {{external force}}. This means that the total momentum before and after an event in the system will be the same, assuming no {{external forces}} are applied. In [mathematical] terms, if P is the total momentum of the system, then dP/dt = 0, where t is time. This principle is used in various {{engineering}} and {{design}} applications, such as collision analysis, structural analysis, and system design, to ensure that the momentum of the system is conserved, and the system remains stable and safe.
