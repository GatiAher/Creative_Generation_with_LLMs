"Nuclear Energy" serves as a powerful and efficient source of electricity generation, capable of producing large amounts of energy from a small amount of fuel. This makes it a valuable resource in meeting the world's increasing energy demands while reducing our reliance on "fossil fuels". "Nuclear Energy" is released through nuclear fission, a process where the nucleus of a heavy atom, such as "uranium" or "plutonium", is split into two smaller nuclei, releasing a large amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation. This process is initiated by bombarding the nucleus with a neutron, which causes the nucleus to become unstable and "split". The released neutrons then initiate a chain reaction, where they collide with other heavy nuclei, causing them to also "split" and release more neutrons and energy. This chain reaction is carefully controlled in a "nuclear reactor" to generate a steady stream of heat, which is used to produce steam and drive a turbine to generate electricity. The reactor is designed with multiple safety mechanisms to prevent a runaway chain reaction and ensure safe and efficient operation.
