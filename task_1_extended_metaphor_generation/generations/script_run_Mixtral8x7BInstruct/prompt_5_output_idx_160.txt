"Choreography Creation Process"

Explanation:

* The creation of Kpop choreography can be thought of as a "blueprint-to-product assembly line" where a series of precise steps and calculations are followed to convert the initial concept or idea into a final dance routine.
* The choreography is created through a "systematic mapping process" where the movements are translated into a sequence of steps using "readers" (choreographers) and "instructional guides" (dancers) that interact in a coordinated and geometrically-constrained manner.
* The "start-stop mechanism" is an essential part of the choreography creation process, ensuring that the dance routine is accurate and controlled, similar to how a programming language works. The choreographer must carefully plan when each move starts and stops to create a cohesive and polished final product.
