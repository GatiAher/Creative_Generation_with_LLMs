  "purpose": "Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, and maintaining reliable, efficient, and high-quality software systems that meet specific user needs and requirements. It aims to create software that is scalable, maintainable, and adaptable to changing user needs and technology advancements.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of Software Engineering involves the application of mathematical, engineering, and design principles to the software development lifecycle. This includes requirements analysis, system design, implementation, testing, maintenance, and management. Geometry and topology concepts are used in the design phase to model and visualize the software architecture, while algorithms and data structures from mathematics are used to implement efficient and reliable software components. Additionally, engineering principles such as modularity, abstraction, and reusability are applied to ensure the maintainability and adaptability of the software system."
