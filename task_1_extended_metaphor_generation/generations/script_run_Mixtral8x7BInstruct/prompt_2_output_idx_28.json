  "purpose": "Food chains represent the flow of energy and nutrients within an ecosystem, facilitating the efficient use and cycling of resources to maintain balance and sustainability.",
  "mechanism": "In geometric terms, food chains are a series of interconnected vectors, each representing a species, with the direction of energy flow indicated by arrowheads. The length and magnitude of these vectors reflect the biomass and trophic level of the organisms involved. This linear structure, reminiscent of a design blueprint, optimizes resource allocation and waste management by minimizing competition and maximizing efficiency, much like an engineering system."
