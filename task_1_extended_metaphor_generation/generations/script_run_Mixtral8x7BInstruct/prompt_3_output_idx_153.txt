"""Electrical Energy {{enables the transformation and transportation of energy in a controlled and efficient manner,}} facilitating various applications in technology, communication, and daily life. Electrical Energy is based on the movement of {{electric charges (often electrons)}}} through a conductor, such as a wire. This movement is driven by {{potential difference (voltage)}} and results in the flow of current. The rate of energy transfer is determined by the [[product]] of voltage, current, and time. Engineers and designers utilize [[geometric]] concepts, like [[circuit design]] and [[layout]]}, to optimize energy transfer, minimize losses, and ensure safety and efficiency in electrical systems."""
