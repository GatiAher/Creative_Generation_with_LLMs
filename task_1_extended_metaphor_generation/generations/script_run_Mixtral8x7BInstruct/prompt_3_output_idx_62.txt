"To provide a more accurate representation of the {{electron distribution}} and {{bonding situation}} in a molecule, when a single {{Lewis structure}} is insufficient, {{\[resonance structures\]\}} help to evenly distribute charge and/or achieve stable electron configurations. {{\[Resonance structures\]\}} are multiple {{Lewis structures}} with the same arrangement of atoms, but differing {{electron distributions}}. These structures are used to describe the {{\[delocalization of electrons\]\}} , meaning that {{electrons}} are not confined to a single location. The actual molecule is considered to be a hybrid of all contributing {{\[resonance structures\]\}} , with the true {{electron distribution}} being an average of the {{\[resonance forms\]\}}. This results in a more stable and accurate depiction of the molecule compared to using a single {{Lewis structure}}."
