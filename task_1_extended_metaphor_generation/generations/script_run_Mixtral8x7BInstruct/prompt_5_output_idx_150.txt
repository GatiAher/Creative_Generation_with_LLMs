"Nano-Tech Blueprint"

Explanation:

* Modularity: The nano-tech blueprint contains information for different aspects of the Iron Man suit's construction, functionality, and repair, allowing for modular components to be added, removed, or upgraded as needed.
* Standardization: The nano-tech blueprint uses a consistent and reliable encoding system for the design and assembly of nano-technology components, ensuring compatibility and interoperability.
* Redundancy: The blueprint stores information in a redundant manner, using multiple copies of critical data to improve reliability and robustness in the face of damage or wear.
* Abstraction: The blueprint encodes information at different levels of abstraction, from the design of individual components to the overall architecture of the suit, allowing for efficient management and modification of complex systems.
* Hierarchy: The structure of the nano-tech blueprint is organized hierarchically, with high-level design principles and overall architecture at the top, and detailed specifications and instructions for individual components at the bottom.
