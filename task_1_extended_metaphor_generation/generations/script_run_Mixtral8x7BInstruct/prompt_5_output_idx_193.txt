"Pitch Selection and Optimization"

Explanation:

* Understanding properties and behaviors of substances: In this context, we can think of "substances" as different types of pitches (e.g., fastball, curveball, slider, changeup). Each pitch has unique properties (speed, movement, spin) and behaviors (how it reacts with different types of swings, weather conditions, and batter weaknesses).
* Representation using mathematical terms: Analyzing pitch data can involve mathematical representations, such as calculating the average speed of a pitcher's fastball, the movement of a curveball, or the swing and miss rate of a slider.
* Designing experiments and analyzing data: A pitcher or coach can design experiments by having the pitcher throw different pitches in various situations to gather data on their effectiveness. This data can then be analyzed to refine pitch selection and improve overall performance.
* Understanding underlying principles: Pitch selection and optimization rely on a deep understanding of the geometric and mathematical principles that govern pitches' movement and behavior. Coaches and analysts use this knowledge to make informed decisions about which pitches to throw in specific situations.
