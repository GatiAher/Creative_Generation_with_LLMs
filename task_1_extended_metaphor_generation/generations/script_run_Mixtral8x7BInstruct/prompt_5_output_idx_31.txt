"Monetary value of rare meteorite artifacts"

This feature in the domain of money is related to the value of rare meteorite artifacts that have survived the journey through the atmosphere and struck the ground. The monetary value of these meteorites can be considered a "natural method of transport" of value, as their worth is determined by the natural process of meteoroid transport and impact.

The "friction-based propulsion" of meteoroids through the atmosphere is analogous to the "friction" of economic exchange, where the value of the meteorite is determined by the forces of supply and demand.

The "size and speed-dependent brightness" of meteoroids is similar to the "size and speed-dependent" value of meteorites, as larger and faster-moving meteorites tend to be more valuable due to their rarity and the amount of extraterrestrial material they contain.

Finally, the "survivability of larger meteoroids" is reflected in the survivability of valuable meteorites, as their impact and subsequent preservation can ensure their continued existence and value as rare artifacts.
