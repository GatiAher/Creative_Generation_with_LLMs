Note that this is a creative interpretation of the prompt, as it is quite challenging to find a direct metaphorical link between the two concepts. I have tried to find similarities in the mechanisms and functions of Dwarf Planets and Global fanbase intersection and mathematical analysis of Kpop music chart performance. in Kpop, such as the use of mathematical equations to describe motion and behavior, and the dynamic and ever-changing nature of their respective systems.
