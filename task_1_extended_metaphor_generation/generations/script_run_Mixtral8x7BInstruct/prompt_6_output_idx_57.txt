In this metaphor, Hubble's Law and statistical analysis of player performance trends over distance are compared in terms of their use of proportionality, predictive modeling, observation and measurement, and scientific inquiry. Both Hubble's Law and statistical analysis use proportionality to make estimates and predictions. Hubble's Law uses the relationship between the speed at which a celestial object is moving away from us and
