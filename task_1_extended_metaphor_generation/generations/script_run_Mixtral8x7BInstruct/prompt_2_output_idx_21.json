  "purpose": "The purpose of Spaghettification is to demonstrate the extreme gravitational forces near a naked singularity, where an object would experience drastically different forces on different parts of its body, leading to its stretching and deformation.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of Spaghettification can be explained through the concepts of geometry, math, engineering, and design as follows:- In the context of General Relativity, the gravitational force is determined by the curvature of spacetime, which is described by the metric tensor.- At a naked singularity, the curvature becomes infinite, leading to a drastic difference in the gravitational force experienced by different parts of an object.- The differential force causes the object to stretch and deform, with one end being pulled towards the singularity and the other end being pushed away.- The resulting elongation of the object is reminiscent of a piece of spaghetti, hence the term Spaghettification.- This phenomenon illustrates the extreme conditions that can occur in the vicinity of a naked singularity and the challenges in understanding their behavior within the framework of classical General Relativity."
