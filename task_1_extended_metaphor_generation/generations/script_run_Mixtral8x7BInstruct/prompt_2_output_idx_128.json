  "purpose": "A Stratovolcano serves as a natural pressure valve for the Earth's mantle, releasing built-up magma and gases in a controlled manner, while also creating new land over time through the accumulation of volcanic materials.",
  "mechanism": "The steep, symmetrical slopes of a Stratovolcano are created by the eruption of viscous lava, which flows slowly and does not travel far from the volcanic vent. This lava builds up a solid core, upon which layers of volcanic ash and debris accumulate over time due to explosive eruptions. These layers, composed of fragments of rock, pumice, and other volcanic materials, add to the height and width of the volcano. The structure of the Stratovolcano allows it to store and release magma and gases in a controlled manner, reducing the risk of uncontrolled, destructive eruptions."
