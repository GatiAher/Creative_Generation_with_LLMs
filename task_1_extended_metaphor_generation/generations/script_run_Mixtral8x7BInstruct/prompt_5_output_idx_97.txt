"Artificial turf with energy-absorbing properties" could potentially satisfy the features in the spec. Artificial turf can be designed with complex structures that optimize the absorption of light energy, similar to how plant cells absorb light. The energy absorbed could then be converted and stored in a usable form, such as chemical energy, through a process like photosynthesis. This stored energy could then be utilized by the turf or other organisms that come into contact with it. However, this is a bit of a stretch as this is not a typical feature in baseball and the energy conversion and storage process would not be directly related to the game itself.
