  "purpose": "The Arctic Oscillation (AO) is a climate pattern that influences the distribution of cold air in the Northern Hemisphere. It helps regulate the temperature gradient between the Arctic and lower latitudes, affecting weather patterns in those regions.",
  "mechanism": "The AO is characterized by the strength and position of the polar vortex, a large-scale circulation of air around the Arctic. A strong vortex, associated with a negative AO index, confines cold air to the Arctic, while a weak vortex, associated with a positive AO index, allows cold air to spill into lower latitudes. This behavior can be described using principles from fluid dynamics, where the rotation and pressure of the atmosphere create a self-reinforcing system. The AO index, a mathematical representation of this pattern, is used to quantify the strength and position of the polar vortex, and can be calculated using data from weather stations or satellites. The design of the AO index allows for a consistent and objective measure of this climate pattern, facilitating analysis and prediction of its impacts."
