"Advanced Micro-Repulsor Technology"

This feature could be imagined as a system within Iron Man's suit that serves as a central regulatory organ, releasing beams of energy (like insulin and glucagon) to maintain the suit's optimal performance. The cells specializing in the production and secretion of specific beams of energy reflect the specialization aspect. The dual functionality is satisfied as this technology not only regulates the suit's performance but can also be used offensively or defensively. The well-designed engineering system is represented by the intricate design of the repulsor tech, with individual components having specific tasks for efficient energy management. Lastly, the repulsor's energy transport system could be compared to an intricate plumbing system, delivering energy beams throughout the suit as needed.
