"metaphor": "both Asteroids in solar system and Statistical Analysis of Player and Team Performance in baseball utilize redundancy",
"asteroids": "Multiple asteroids in the solar system provide redundant information about the conditions and behaviors that shaped the system. In case of failure or loss of data from one asteroid, redundant data from other asteroids can ensure continuity and accuracy of information.",
"statistical\_analysis\_of\_player\_and\_team\_performance": "Multiple players and teams provide redundant information about the strategies and trends that shape the game of baseball. In case of injury or poor performance from one player or team, redundant data from other players and teams can provide backup and ensure continuity and accuracy of information."
