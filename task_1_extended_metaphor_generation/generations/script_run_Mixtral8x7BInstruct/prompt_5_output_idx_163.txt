"Minting process"

The minting process is a blueprint-to-product assembly line in the domain of money, as it involves a series of precise steps and calculations to convert raw materials into coins. This process is systematic, with a mapping process that converts a design (the blueprint) into a physical product (the coin). The minting process also has a start-stop mechanism, as it only begins when the raw materials and design are ready, and stops once the desired number of coins has been produced. This mechanism ensures accurate and controlled production of coins, similar to how a programming language controls the execution of a program.
