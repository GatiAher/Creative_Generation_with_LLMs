The {{Jet Stream}} acts as a {{boundary layer}} in the atmosphere, separating and redirecting air masses with different temperatures and humidity levels, thereby playing a crucial role in global weather patterns. The {{Jet Stream}} is formed due to the Earth's rotation and the {{temperature gradient}} between the polar regions and the lower latitudes. This creates a pressure difference, leading to the formation of a fast-moving and narrow {{air current}}. The polar vortex, a large area of low pressure surrounding the Earth's poles, is connected to the Jet Stream and influences its strength and direction.
