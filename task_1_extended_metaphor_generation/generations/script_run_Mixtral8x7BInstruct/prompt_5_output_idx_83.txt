"Monetary Isolation and Irreversibility via Event Horizon of Financial Singularity"

This feature uses the concept of a financial singularity to describe a point of no return in financial transactions, where the "one-way membrane" is an event horizon that prevents the transaction from being reversed or cancelled once initiated. The "demarcation point" is the boundary beyond which money cannot return to the external financial system. The "extreme gravitational forces" represent the powerful constraints and rules that govern financial transactions. The "field equations" are the mathematical models and algorithms that control the interaction between money and financial transactions.
