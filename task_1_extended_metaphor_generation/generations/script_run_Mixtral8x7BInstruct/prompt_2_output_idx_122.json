  "purpose": "The Stratosphere plays a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate and weather patterns by containing and stabilizing the polar vortex, a large-scale cyclone that forms in the polar regions during winter.",
  "mechanism": "The Stratosphere, with its unique design and engineering properties, creates a stable and calm environment, characterized by its increasing temperature with altitude, due to the presence of the ozone layer. This stability allows for the formation and persistence of the polar vortex, which is a circular airflow pattern around the poles. The geometry of the Stratosphere, with its height and width, provides a container for the polar vortex, isolating it from lower latitudes and thus preventing the mixing of cold and warm air masses. This separation maintains the temperature difference between the poles and the equator, driving global circulation patterns and, ultimately, weather and climate."
