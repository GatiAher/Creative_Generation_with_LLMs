The {{reproductive glands}} or {{gonads}} serve as the primary source of {{sex hormones}}, which are crucial in the development and maintenance of {{reproductive systems}} and secondary sexual characteristics. These hormones also play a significant role in the overall homeostasis of the human body. The gonads are [[designed]] as intricate structures containing specialized cells for hormone production. In females, the {{ovaries}}, which are shaped like almonds, are responsible for releasing mature eggs into the {{fallopian tubes}} during ovulation, as well as producing estrogen and progesterone. In males, the {{testes}} are suspended within the scrotum, maintaining a slightly lower temperature than the rest of the body for optimal sperm production. They produce testosterone, the primary male sex hormone. The gonads' structural design and function work in tandem to maintain a delicate balance of sex hormones, which in turn support the overall reproductive and physiological well-being of individuals.
