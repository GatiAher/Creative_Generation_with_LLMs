  "purpose": "Activation Energy serves as a 'threshold' or 'barrier' that must be overcome for a chemical reaction to take place, ensuring that the reaction only occurs when sufficient energy is provided, much like a minimum power requirement for operating a machine.",
  "mechanism": "The Activation Energy is mathematically represented as the difference between the potential energy of the reactants and the 'activated complex' (a high-energy temporary state where bonds are broken and formed). Geometrically, this can be visualized as a 'potential energy surface' with the Activation Energy corresponding to the 'peak' that must be surmounted for the reaction to proceed, similar to the 'summit' of a hill that must be climbed to reach the other side."
