"Choreography Design and Optimization"

Explanation:

1. Understanding properties and behaviors of substances: In choreography design, dancers' movements, formations, and interactions can be thought of as "substances" with unique properties and behaviors. By analyzing and understanding these properties (e.g., dancers' strengths, weaknesses, and styles), choreographers can create more harmonious and efficient performances.
2. Representation using mathematical terms: Mathematical concepts such as symmetry, rhythm, and synchronization play a crucial role in choreography. Dancers' movements can be represented using variables and coefficients, and mathematical equations can help express the relationship between the dancers' movements and the music.
3. Designing experiments and analyzing data: Choreographers often experiment with different formations, movements, and transitions to optimize their performances. By analyzing data from rehearsals and performances, choreographers can refine their choreography and improve the overall quality of the performance.
4. Understanding underlying principles: Geometric and mathematical principles underlie the design and execution of Kpop choreography. For example, choreographers may use principles of symmetry to create visually appealing formations or apply mathematical concepts to synchronize dancers' movements with the beat of the music.
