  "purpose": "The purpose of Seafloor Spreading is to constantly create and expand the ocean floor, which helps to balance the loss of crustal material at subduction zones and thus maintain the overall stability of the Earth's crust.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of Seafloor Spreading involves the creation of new oceanic lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges due to the upwelling of magma from the mantle. As the magma cools and solidifies, it forms new crust that is pushed away from the ridge on either side, causing the ridge to spread apart and the ocean floor to expand. This process is driven by the movement of tectonic plates and is an example of a convergent boundary in the context of plate tectonics."
