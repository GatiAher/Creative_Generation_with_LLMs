  "purpose": "The purpose of Catalysis is to accelerate the reaction rate of a chemical process, thereby increasing the efficiency and reducing the energy requirements of the system, without itself being consumed or altered in the process.",
  "mechanism": "Catalysis functions by providing an alternative reaction pathway with lower activation energy compared to the uncatalyzed reaction. This is achieved through the precise geometric arrangement of atoms in the catalyst, which facilitates the temporary binding of reactants and the transition states. The catalyst then lowers the energy barrier for the reaction to occur, allowing it to proceed more quickly. The catalyst is regenerated in each reaction cycle, allowing it to continue facilitating the reaction."
