"Choreography"

Explanation:

* Choreography in Kpop serves as a "blueprint" for the dance performances of Kpop groups. It is a master plan that guides the movements and actions of the performers.
* The creation of choreography requires "specialization" in the form of skilled choreographers who design and teach the dance routines to the performers. These choreographers move along the "DNA template" of the song, translating its rhythm and melody into precise dance movements.
* Choreography in Kpop also requires "precision" in its execution. Every movement, from the smallest hand gesture to the most complex formation change, must be executed with accuracy and synchronization. This requires careful practice and rehearsal to ensure that the geometric patterns and formations of the dance are implemented with mathematical precision.
