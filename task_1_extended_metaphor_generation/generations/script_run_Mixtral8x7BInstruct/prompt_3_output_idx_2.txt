"Dwarf Planets" serve as key markers in understanding the composition and history of our "solar system". They, along with other "celestial bodies", provide valuable insights into the "[geometric patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry)" and "[mathematical relationships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_relationship)" that govern the behavior of objects in space. "Dwarf Planets" are spherical in shape, which is a result of their "[gravitational forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravity)" and material composition. This "[geometric shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry)" allows them to have a large surface area in relation to their volume, which can increase the chances of detecting and studying them. The "[orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit)" of Dwarf Planets follow "[elliptical paths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipse)" around the sun, which can be described using "[mathematical equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_model)". The "[orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbit)" of these celestial bodies also often intersect with other debris, demonstrating the dynamic and ever-changing nature of the solar system. Despite not having "[cleared their orbits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clearing_the_neighbourhood)", Dwarf Planets still meet many of the same "[geometric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometry)", "[mathematical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics)", and "[engineering principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering)" that define other planets.
