"Diversified Investment Portfolio"

Explanation:

* Absorption and Sacrifice: A diversified portfolio acts as a sacrificial barrier by spreading investments across various assets, reducing the impact of potential losses in one area.
* Spherical Formation: Although not a perfect match, a diversified portfolio can be metaphorically described as a "spherical formation" because it covers multiple investment categories, creating a protective zone for the investor's wealth.
* Gravitational Force: In this context, "gravitational force" represents the attractive power of promising investment opportunities. A diversified portfolio allows investors to capture and benefit from various investment prospects, similar to how celestial bodies attract and capture objects within their gravitational field.
