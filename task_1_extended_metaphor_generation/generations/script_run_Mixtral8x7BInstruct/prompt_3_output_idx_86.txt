The {{Web API}} serves as a bridge that connects different software applications, allowing them to communicate and exchange data seamlessly. It enables the creation of dynamic and interactive web experiences, much like how [[geometric shapes]] can interconnect to form a complex structure. The {{Web API}} is built upon the foundations of HTTP and {{JSON}} or {{XML}} for data interchange, similar to how mathematical equations and engineering principles underpin the design of a structure. It follows the RESTful architecture style, allowing for stateless communication between clients and servers. The API exposes a set of [[endpoints]], or 'blueprints', that define how data can be requested or modified, using HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. This structure supports the purpose of the {{Web API}} by providing a standardized and scalable way for different software applications to interact, regardless of their underlying technology or platform.
