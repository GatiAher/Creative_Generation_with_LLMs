{Ecosystem services} provide essential resources and regulatory functions that support human well-being and economic activity, including the provisioning of {clean air} and {water}, the regulation of {climate} and {disease}, and the support of food production and biodiversity. {Ecosystem services} are the result of the complex interactions and processes within ecosystems, which can be understood using [[mathematical and engineering concepts]] such as feedback loops, emergent properties, and system optimization. At a fundamental level, the structure of ecosystems, composed of various [[biotic and abiotic components]], is designed to optimize the use of resources and energy, leading to the emergence of regulatory and supportive functions that benefit humans. For example, the [[geometric arrangement]] of plants in a forest can optimize light capture and water use, leading to the provisioning of {clean air} and the regulation of climate. Similarly, the diversity of species in an ecosystem can be seen as a form of redundancy in a [[mathematical system]], increasing its resilience and stability. By understanding these mechanisms, it is possible to design and manage ecosystems in a way that maximizes their beneficial services to humans.
