"Iron Man's hyperdense Arc Reactor" could be a feature that loosely fits the given spec. However, it's important to note that the spec is more aligned with the properties of black holes in astrophysics, while Iron Man's Arc Reactor is a fictional power source.

The Arc Reactor could be considered as having an "extreme concentration of mass" since it's a highly efficient and compact power source. It doesn't warp the fabric of reality or intensify gravity like a black hole, but it's the most massive and powerful component in Iron Man's suit.

The "divergence of spacetime curvature" and "modeling with solutions to field equations" are concepts more applicable to black holes and general relativity, and aren't directly related to the Arc Reactor.

The "event horizon" could be compared to the Arc Reactor's containment field, which prevents the highly reactive and dangerous energy from escaping and causing harm. However, this is a loose comparison, as the Arc Reactor's containment field doesn't prevent direct observation or interaction with the power source itself.
