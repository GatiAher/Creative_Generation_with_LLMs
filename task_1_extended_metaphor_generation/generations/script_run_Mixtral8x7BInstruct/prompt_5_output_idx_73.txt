There is no direct feature in the domain of baseball that satisfies all the features of the given spec, as it is primarily focused on the concepts of black holes and general relativity. However, if we consider a metaphorical interpretation related to the game, we could say that the "pitcher's mound" somewhat resembles the "divergence of spacetime curvature" and "event horizon" aspects.

The pitcher's mound is the raised area where the pitcher stands, and its shape and height can influence the trajectory and movement of pitched balls, much like how spacetime is curved around a black hole. The event horizon could be compared to the point where a pitcher releases the ball, as once the ball leaves the pitcher's hand, it can no longer be directly influenced or interacted with by the pitcher, just as we cannot directly observe or interact with the singularity at the center of a black hole beyond the event horizon.

However, it's important to note that this is a significant stretch in applying the concepts from the spec to baseball, and the comparison is more of a creative interpretation rather than a direct match.
