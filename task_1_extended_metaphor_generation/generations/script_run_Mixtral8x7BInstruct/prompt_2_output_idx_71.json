  "purpose": "The Collision Theory is a model that aims to describe and predict the conditions under which chemical reactions are likely to occur, by considering the geometric alignments and kinetic energies of colliding particles.",
  "mechanism": "The Collision Theory posits that for a reaction to occur, molecules must geometrically collide with each other, with sufficient energy (known as the activation energy) to overcome the repulsive forces between them. This energy threshold and the alignment of the molecules' approach determine the likelihood of a successful reaction. By analyzing these factors, the Collision Theory can estimate the reaction cross section, reaction rate, and overall reaction efficiency."
