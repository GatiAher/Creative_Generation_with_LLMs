"The effect of spin rate on baseball's trajectory causing unpredictable curves and breaks due to the differential force and the curvature of spacetime around the spinning ball."

While this explanation uses some artistic license to connect the concepts of spacetime curvature and differential force to baseball, the idea is that the spin of a pitched baseball can cause the air around it to move differently, creating a region of higher pressure on one side of the ball and lower pressure on the other. This differential force can lead to the ball moving in unpredictable ways, similar to how the extreme gravitational force near a massive object can cause stretching and deformation.

Furthermore, the spinning motion of the baseball can be seen as creating a tiny curvature of spacetime around the ball, similar to how the curvature of spacetime is responsible for gravitational forces. While this curvature is minuscule and not related to general relativity, it is still a useful way to think about the behavior of the baseball in flight.
