			"metaphor": "both Thyroid Gland in endocrine system and Central banking system in money have a negative feedback loop that ensures homeostasis and fine-tunes the system according to the body's needs",
			"thyroid\_gland": "The production and release of thyroid hormones are controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, forming a negative feedback loop that maintains homeostasis and fine-tunes the metabolic rate according to the body's needs.",
			"central\_banking\_system": "The central banking system has a similar mechanism in place, with interest rates serving as the primary tool to control the money supply and maintain economic stability. By adjusting interest rates based on economic conditions, the central banking system fine-tunes the economy to ensure stability and prevent excessive inflation or deflation."

			"thyroid\_gland": "The thyroid gland acts as a metabolic control center, regulating the rate at which energy is produced and consumed within the body, thereby affecting growth, development, and overall system efficiency.",
			"central\_banking\_system": "The central banking system acts as an economic control center, regulating the money supply and interest rates to ensure economic stability, growth, and overall system efficiency. By influencing the rate of economic activities, the central banking system helps maintain a stable and prosperous economy."
