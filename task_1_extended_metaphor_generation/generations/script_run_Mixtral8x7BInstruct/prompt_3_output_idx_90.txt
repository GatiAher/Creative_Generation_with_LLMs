The {{API Key}} serves as a unique identifier for a client, allowing the server to recognize and track the client's requests. It ensures accountability and security by enabling the server to monitor and control the client's access and usage. The {{API Key}} is a [string] of characters, similar to a [[coordinate]] in geometry or an {{identifier}} in math. It is generated and assigned to a client by the server. The client then includes this key in each request it makes to the server, acting as a 'digital key' that allows the server to authenticate and validate the request. The key's unique and unchanging nature provides a consistent and reliable means of identifying and tracking the client, much like a fixed point in [engineering] or a consistent design element in a [[blueprint]].
