      "mechanism": "The trophic system in an ecosystem can be thought of as a hierarchical system for converting and transferring energy, similar to a supply chain in engineering or manufacturing. This structure allows for an efficient distribution and use of energy within the ecosystem, maximizing the potential for growth and survival of the organisms within it."

      "description": "Modular and self-organizing system",
      "mechanism": "The trophic system can be seen as a modular and self-organizing system, where the addition or removal of species at one level does not necessarily affect the functioning of the other levels. This allows for a high degree of resilience and adaptability within the ecosystem."

      "description": "Geometric representation as a pyramid",
      "mechanism": "The trophic system can be visualized as a pyramid, with the producers at the base and the decomposers at the top. This pyramid shape represents the decreasing amount of energy and biomass available at each higher level."
