""{{Chemical Energy}} serves as a form of {{potential energy}} that powers various phenomena and processes, enabling transformations and interactions in the world. It facilitates reactions and conversions, releasing or absorbing energy in the form of heat, light, or {{motion}}. {{Chemical Energy}} is stored in the bonds between atoms or molecules within chemical compounds. These bonds can be visualized as {[geometric structures]}, with specific angles and distances between atoms. The energy associated with these bonds is determined by the mathematical principles of {{quantum mechanics}} and electrostatics. Engineering and design principles are applied to manipulate and control chemical reactions, harnessing the energy stored in these bonds to perform work or produce desired outcomes."""
