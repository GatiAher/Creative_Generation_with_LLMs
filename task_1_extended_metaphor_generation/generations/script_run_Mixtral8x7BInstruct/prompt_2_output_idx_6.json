  "purpose": "Meteoroids serve as important components in the process of natural space debris removal, contributing to the overall maintenance of a cleaner orbital environment in the solar system. Additionally, they provide scientists with valuable insights about the composition and properties of other celestial bodies such as comets and asteroids.",
  "mechanism": "Meteoroids are typically small, solid particles made up of rock, metal, or a combination of both. They originate from comets or asteroids and move through space at high speeds. When a meteoroid enters the Earth's atmosphere, the friction generated by its high-speed motion causes it to heat up and vaporize, resulting in the phenomenon known as a shooting star or meteor. The study of meteoroids, their composition, and their trajectories can reveal important information about the celestial bodies they originated from, as well as the forces that act upon them in space, such as gravity and radiation pressure."
