"Iron Man's extra-terrestrial laboratory and research facility" - This feature could be a series of miniaturized celestial bodies, each with a unique mass, size, and composition, created using advanced technology. These bodies would be designed following the laws of geometry and mathematics, specifically Kepler's laws of planetary motion, to allow for the study of orbital shapes, sizes, and times. Additionally, the movement and interactions of these celestial bodies would contribute to the overall dynamic stability and structure of the system, making it a complex and fascinating system to study. This lab would allow Iron Man to conduct experiments and research on celestial phenomena and potential life support systems in a controlled environment.
