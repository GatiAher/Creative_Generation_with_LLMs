Covalent bonds and Kpop stages alike,
Their connection secure, their design in sync.
Atoms share electrons, a collaborative pact,
Members unite, each with a unique impact.

Like a sturdy structure, they stand strong,
Working together, creating a bond lifelong.
Balanced and cohesive, their essence aligned,
In both worlds, harmony you'll find.
