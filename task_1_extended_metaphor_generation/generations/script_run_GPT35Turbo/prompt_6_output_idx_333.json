      "metaphor": "both Chemical Energy in energy and Pitching mechanics in baseball have the Storage and Release Principle in common",
      "chemical_energy": "The Storage and Release Principle enables the storage of potential energy within atomic bonds and subsequent release during chemical reactions. In chemical energy, this principle allows compounds to store energy and release it when needed for various processes.",
      "pitching_mechanics": "Similarly, in pitching mechanics, the pitcher stores potential energy in their body through a series of movements and releases it during the pitch. The pitcher's movement stores energy like potential energy in chemical bonds, which is then released in a controlled manner to propel the ball towards the target."

      "metaphor": "both Chemical Energy in energy and Pitching mechanics in baseball have the Structural Design Principle in common",
      "chemical_energy": "The Structural Design Principle involves designing the specific arrangements of atoms and molecules in a compound to store potential energy in bonds. This principle allows for the manipulation of molecules to optimize energy storage.",
      "pitching_mechanics": "Similarly, in pitching mechanics, the pitcher's body is aligned and moves in specific sequences to optimize the transfer of energy from the body to the ball during the pitch. Just as atoms are arranged in compounds to maximize energy storage, a pitcher's body is positioned and moves in such a way to maximize the transfer of energy to the pitch."

      "metaphor": "both Chemical Energy in energy and Pitching mechanics in baseball have the Transformation Principle in common",
      "chemical_energy": "The Transformation Principle allows for the facilitation of energy transformation for various uses through chemical reactions. This principle is essential for converting energy from one form to another based on the needs of the system.",
      "pitching_mechanics": "In pitching mechanics, the Transformation Principle is reflected in how a pitcher converts the stored potential energy into kinetic energy to propel the ball. The pitcher's movements transform the potential energy stored in their body into kinetic energy for the pitch, similar to how chemical reactions transform energy from bonds into usable forms."
