Like a scientist with Radiogenic Isotope Analysis,
Or a baseball team using Statcast precision analysis,
Both employ mathematical modeling to enhance their skills,
Calculating age or analyzing player thrills.

With precise engineering, they both make their mark,
Reconstructing history or evaluating player spark,
In both fields, accuracy is key,
For understanding the past or hitting a home run spree.
