Just like a volcano's vent and pitcher's mound,
Both have mechanisms where energy is found.
One releases pressure to prevent explosion's might,
The other delivers pitches with aim that's right.

Geometric designs in both can be seen,
Allowing materials to rise or pitches to keen.
Whether magma or ball, they move with ease,
Through openings designed to please.
