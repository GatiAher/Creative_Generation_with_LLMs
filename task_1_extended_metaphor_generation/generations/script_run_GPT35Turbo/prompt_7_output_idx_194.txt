In the realm of technology's vast domain,
GraphQL API and J.A.R.V.I.S. reign.
With principles like modular geometry's grace,
They handle tasks with efficiency and pace.

Like Tony's armors for missions diverse,
GraphQL's SRP ensures data's traverse.
J.A.R.V.I.S., with tasks of varied kinds,
Processes seamlessly, like GraphQL's binds.

Modularity, a principle they both share,
Customizing functions with utmost care.
Just as Tony assembles suits with ease,
J.A.R.V.I.S. adapts to tech's swift breeze.

Separating concerns, they both excel,
Structured processing, they do compel.
Delivering data with precision's hand,
Like a tailored suit or a tech-savvy band.

In API and Iron Man's futuristic lore,
They embody principles that open new doors.
