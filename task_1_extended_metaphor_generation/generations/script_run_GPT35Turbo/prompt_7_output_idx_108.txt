Concept albums in Kpop are like chemical reactions,
With Conservation and Kinetics as their factions.
Their products and themes, both meticulously designed,
Maintaining mass and energy, just like a chemical bind.

From the balance of emotions to the album's pace,
Like reactions, they follow a specific case.
Thermodynamics and coherence in theme,
Concept albums in Kpop, a well-structured scheme.
