Endocrine glands and pitchers, 
Redundancy in their core,
One transmits signals, the other pitches,
Both key players, ready to score.

Resilient nodes in a complex system,
Ensuring messages reach their mark,
Whether in the body or on the diamond,
They adapt and conquer the dark.

Efficient in their functionality,
Delivering with speed and precision,
From bloodstream to strike zone tactically,
Controlling the game with decision.
