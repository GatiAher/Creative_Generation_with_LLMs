Like atoms in compounds, each in their own place,
Chemical energy and pitching, with principles to embrace.
Storage and release, where energy is stored and then freed,
In both realms, it's the key to succeed.

Structural design, arranging elements just right,
Optimizing energy transfer, day and night.
From molecules to bodies, the pattern is clear,
Efficiency in movement, to pitch with no fear.

Transformation principle, a shift in the tide,
Converting potential into motion, with nothing to hide.
Chemical reactions and pitching, they share the same fate,
Transforming energy, to conquer and create.
