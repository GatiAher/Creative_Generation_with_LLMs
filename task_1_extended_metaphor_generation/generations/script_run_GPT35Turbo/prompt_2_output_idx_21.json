  "purpose": "Hormones act as signaling modules ensuring proper communication between different components of an interconnected system, facilitating dynamic adjustments in response to varying external and internal conditions.",
  "mechanism": "Hormones are designed as precise, targeted entities with specific chemical compositions that enable them to navigate through the bloodstream, reaching designated receptor sites like perfectly shaped puzzle pieces. This geometrically structured design allows hormones to trigger specific responses in target organs or tissues, akin to a well-engineered control system activating the necessary functions in the overall network."
