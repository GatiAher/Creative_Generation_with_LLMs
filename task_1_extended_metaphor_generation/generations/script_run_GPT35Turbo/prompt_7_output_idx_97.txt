Like a finely tuned system,  
Both Thyroid Gland and the Pitch Control  
Maintain balance with precision,  
Adjusting based on feedback they patrol.  

Thyroid Gland regulates metabolism,  
Ensuring the body works optimally,  
Much like a pitcher's rhythm,  
Adjusting pitch location crucially.  

They operate like a closed-loop,  
Monitoring and adjusting with care,  
Keeping equilibrium in a group,  
Both systems handling their share.
