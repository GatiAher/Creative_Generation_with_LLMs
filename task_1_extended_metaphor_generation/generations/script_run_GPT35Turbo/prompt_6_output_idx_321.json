        "description": "Pitcher's wind-up in baseball",
        "purpose": "In baseball, a pitcher's wind-up serves to gather potential energy and momentum before releasing the ball with maximal force and accuracy.",
        "mechanism": "Similarly to Potential Energy, the pitcher's wind-up involves positioning (spatial orientation) and accumulating energy (stored potential) which is then converted into kinetic energy during the pitch."

        "purpose": "The principle that an object's position in a gravitational field determines the amount of potential energy it possesses, with higher positioning resulting in greater potential energy.",
        "mechanism": "Objects at higher gravitational potential have more stored energy, akin to a pitcher winding up to their maximum height to prepare for a stronger throw."

        "purpose": "The pitcher's height and positioning during the wind-up impact the energy transferred to the pitch upon release.",
        "mechanism": "Just like gravitational potential energy, the pitcher's height and position affect the amount of energy stored and later released during the pitch."
