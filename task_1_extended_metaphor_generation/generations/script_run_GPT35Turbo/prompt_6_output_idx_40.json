      "metaphor": "Both Singularities in the theory of the naked singularity and 'Complex choreography breakdown' in Kpop have a breakdown in structured geometric framework. This principle allows for extreme structures with infinite values in key parameters such as density and gravity, leading to a breakdown in traditional geometric frameworks and spacetime.",
