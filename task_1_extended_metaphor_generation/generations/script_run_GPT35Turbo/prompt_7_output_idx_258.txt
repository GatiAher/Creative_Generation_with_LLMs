In circuits of control, they both reside,
Arctic Oscillation and J.A.R.V.I.S. side by side.
One in the vortex, the other in red,
Regulating systems in balance, ahead.

Negative and positive phases they chase,
Confine or allow, in dynamic grace.
Strength variations at their command,
Guiding the flow, like a delicate hand. 

Arctic winds and Iron Man's might,
Bound by systems, in balance and right.
In the dance of control, they both hold sway,
Adjusting and regulating, day by day.
