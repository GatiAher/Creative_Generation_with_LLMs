Like a dance of heat and fire,
Endothermic reactions and the Arc Reactor aspire.
Absorbing thermal energy from without,
To stabilize and change, they go about.

In chemical compounds or Iron Man's heart,
Both systems consume heat to play their part.
Fueling reactions and powering suits,
Their similarity in thermal energy pursuits.
