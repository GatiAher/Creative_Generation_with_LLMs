In ecosystems and baseball alike,
Hierarchical design takes flight.
From food chain to pitching delivery's flow,
Energy transfer efficiency, they both show.

Optimizing resources, data, and pitch,
Ensures success without a glitch.
Like a pipeline system, tiered and strong,
Moving energy from source to where it belongs.
