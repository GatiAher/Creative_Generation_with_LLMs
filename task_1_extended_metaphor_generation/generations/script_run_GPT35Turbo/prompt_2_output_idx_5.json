  "purpose": "The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation serves as a foundational blueprint of the universe, providing critical insight into its early stages and overall geometry, aiding in the understanding of cosmic engineering and design principles.",
  "mechanism": "The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, being a uniform and isotropic radiation field, is structured as a residual signal from the hot, dense state of the early universe, revealing the geometry of the universe at that time. This structure supports the purpose by offering a snapshot of the initial conditions and evolution of the universe, enabling detailed mathematical modeling and analysis of its design."
