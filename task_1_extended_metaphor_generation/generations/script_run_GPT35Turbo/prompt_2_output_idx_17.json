  "purpose": "Genes act as the blueprint or code that allows for the efficient construction of proteins, analogous to a set of precise mathematical formulas guiding the creation of complex geometric shapes.",
  "mechanism": "Genes are organized sequences within the DNA molecule, resembling structured architectural designs with specific segmentations and sequences that dictate the precise order and arrangement of amino acids during protein synthesis."
