Planets in space, Iron Man's flight,
Both seek equilibrium with all their might.
Elliptical paths and math's embrace,
Keeping stability in their cosmic race.

Gravitational forces guide their way,
In precise balance, they always stay.
Orbital configurations, stable and true,
Planets and repulsors, following through.
