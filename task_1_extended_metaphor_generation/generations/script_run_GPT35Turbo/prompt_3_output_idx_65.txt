"""The {{Jet Stream}} provides a dynamic boundary in the atmosphere that influences the behavior and distribution of atmospheric pressures and temperatures, contributing to the regulation of global weather patterns. The Jet Stream is characterized by a concentrated path of high winds, forming along the boundaries of {{temperature}} and {{pressure gradients}} in the atmosphere. Its narrow and concentrated structure allows for the transport of energy and momentum across large distances, enabling the Jet Stream to drive the movement and behavior of weather systems, including the {{polar vortex}}."""
