"""Isotope Fractionation serves as a tool to discern the intricate details of natural processes at a molecular level by examining the separation of {{isotopes}} of an element, contributing to a deeper understanding of the forces governing such processes. Isotope Fractionation operates based on the principle that isotopes of an element exhibit different behavior due to their atomic composition. This leads to their separation during natural processes, resulting in distinct fractions with {{isotopic compositions}} that can be analyzed to uncover the underlying mechanisms at play."""
