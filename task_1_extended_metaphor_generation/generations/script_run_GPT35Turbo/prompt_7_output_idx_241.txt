Scale on maps and baseball fields,
Proportions maintained, accuracy yields.
From mountain peaks to outfield fences,
Consistency prevails, no pretenses.

Ratio in maps, true dimensions revealed,
Navigation made easy, paths congealed.
Bases and fences, ratios adhere,
Games played fair, rules clear.

Consistency in scaling, map remains true,
Reliable for journeys, accurate view.
Field dimensions same, across the board,
Gameplay standard, integrity restored.
