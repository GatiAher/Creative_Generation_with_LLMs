      "metaphor": "both Equilibrium in chemical reaction and Flight Stabilization System in Iron Man have the characteristic of Dynamic Equilibrium, structured based on the principle of dynamic equilibrium, where forward and reverse actions occur at the same rate to maintain stability.",
      "equilibrium": "The concept of Dynamic Equilibrium in chemical reactions ensures that the rates of forward and reverse reactions are balanced, maintaining a stable concentration of reactants and products.",
      "flight_stabilization_system": "Similarly, the Flight Stabilization System in Iron Man constantly adjusts the suit's position and orientation to achieve a dynamic equilibrium, where corrections in flight are made seamlessly to maintain stability and control."
