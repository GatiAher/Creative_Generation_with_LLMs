Just like the Greenhouse Effect's embrace,
Dance covers in Kpop hold the dance's grace.
Insulation mechanism, they both share,
Keeping warmth and essence with care.

Greenhouse gases and dance moves intertwine,
Trapping heat and choreography divine.
A barrier they create, a blanket so tight,
Preserving energy, both day and night.
