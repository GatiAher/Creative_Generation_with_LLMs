"""{{Radiogenic Isotope Analysis}} serves the purpose of uncovering the history and timeframe of {{geological specimens}} by examining the changes in isotopic composition resulting from radioactive decay. {{Radiogenic Isotope Analysis}} works by measuring the ratios of parent and daughter isotopes in a sample, utilizing [mathematical models] to calculate the time since the radioactive decay process began. This method is designed to provide precise age estimation and trace the origins of geological materials with accuracy."""
