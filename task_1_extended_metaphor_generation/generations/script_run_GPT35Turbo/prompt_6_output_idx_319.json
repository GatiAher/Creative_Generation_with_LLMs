      "metaphor": "Both Kinetic Energy in energy and Compound interest in money have mechanisms that help in understanding the underlying values and impact without the need for direct measurement.",
      "kinetic_energy": "Kinetic energy calculates the energy associated with the motion of objects by considering factors like velocity and mass. It uses the squared value of velocity to determine the energy, showing that objects with higher velocities or greater mass have more potential impact.",
      "compound_interest": "Compound interest functions in a similar way to kinetic energy by determining how money grows over time without requiring constant tracking. It takes into account factors like the initial principal amount and the interest rate, reflecting how the growth compounds and accelerates over time, much like the impact of velocity on kinetic energy."
