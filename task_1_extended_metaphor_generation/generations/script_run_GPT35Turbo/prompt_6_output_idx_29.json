      "metaphor": "both Singularity in big bang theory and Pitching motion in baseball have Compression as a crucial element",
      "singularity": "Compression involves compressing matter to infinite density to initiate the universe in a highly concentrated state. This sets the stage for the immense energy release and expansion that follows.",
      "pitching_motion": "In Pitching motion, the pitcher compresses the energy stored in their body and then releases it in a highly concentrated manner to propel the ball forward with great speed and force, setting the stage for the play that ensues."

      "metaphor": "both Singularity in big bang theory and Pitching motion in baseball involve Foundation Establishment",
      "singularity": "Foundation Establishment is about creating a foundation from the highly compressed state to enable the unfolding of fundamental laws for the formation of the universe. It establishes the groundwork for the universe to evolve and expand.",
      "pitching_motion": "In Pitching motion, the pitcher establishes a solid foundation by utilizing proper mechanics and technique to initiate the play. This foundation enables the pitcher to throw accurately and with power, setting the stage for the game's progression."

      "metaphor": "both Singularity in big bang theory and Pitching motion in baseball encompass Structuring",
      "singularity": "Structuring involves organizing the point in space-time characterized by infinite density to serve as the starting point for the universe's expansion. It lays the structural framework for the universe to develop and grow.",
      "pitching_motion": "In Pitching motion, the pitcher structurally positions their body and arm to generate the maximum force and accuracy when throwing the ball. This structuring is essential to deliver a pitch that can lead to a successful play, setting the stage for the game's dynamics."
