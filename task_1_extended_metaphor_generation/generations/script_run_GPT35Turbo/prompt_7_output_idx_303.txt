Like tectonic plates drifting in Earth's domain,
Financial diversification seeks to maintain
A balance and equilibrium in its design,
Spreading investments like land in a grand design.

Structural optimization guides the way,
Both in shifting continents and financial display,
Minimizing stress, maximizing stability,
In nature and money, it's the key to ability.
