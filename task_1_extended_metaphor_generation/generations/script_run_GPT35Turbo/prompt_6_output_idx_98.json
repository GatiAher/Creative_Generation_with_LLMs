      "metaphor": "both Thyroid Gland in endocrine system and J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) in Iron Man have a Feedback Control System that modulates the rate of various processes to maintain balance. They continuously monitor and adjust based on feedback.",
      "thyroid_gland": "The Thyroid Gland in the endocrine system serves as a feedback control system which regulates the metabolism and other body functions by secreting hormones like thyroxine. It continuously monitors the body's hormonal levels and adjusts the secretion to ensure a balance in metabolic activities.",
      "j.a.r.v.i.s._(just_a_rather_very_intelligent_system)": "J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) in Iron Man functions similarly to a feedback control system. It constantly monitors Tony Stark's surroundings, suit status, and provides real-time feedback to assist in decision-making and action. Just like the Thyroid Gland, J.A.R.V.I.S. adjusts its responses based on the feedback received to help maintain balance and efficiency."

      "metaphor": "both Thyroid Gland in endocrine system and J.A.R.V.I.S. (Just A Rather Very Intelligent System) in Iron Man operate as Closed-loop Systems, monitoring levels and adjusting secretion to regulate activities.",
      "thyroid_gland": "The Thyroid Gland operates as a closed-loop system within the endocrine system. It monitors the blood levels of hormones like TSH and thyroid hormones to adjust its secretion accordingly, ensuring that metabolic activities are regulated within normal ranges.",
      "j.a.r.v.i.s._(just_a_rather_very_intelligent_system)": "Similarly, J.A.R.V.I.S. functions as a closed-loop system in Iron Man's suit operations. It monitors various parameters such as power levels, suit integrity, and external threats to make real-time adjustments and recommendations, acting as a regulatory system that maintains Iron Man's efficiency and safety during missions."
