  "purpose": "Volcanic Eruptions serve as a natural mechanism for the release of internal pressure within a volcano. This release prevents potential explosive build-up of gases and magma inside the volcano, helping to maintain a stable equilibrium.",
  "mechanism": "Volcanic Eruptions are structured as the eruption of magma, gases, and ash through a vent or fissure in the Earth's crust. The pressure from the accumulating materials beneath the surface leads to the formation of a conduit, allowing the volcanic materials to rise and escape, relieving the internal pressure."
