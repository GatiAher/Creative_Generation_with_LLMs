"{{Mechanical Energy}}" serves as a comprehensive measure of an object's combined {{kinetic}} and {{potential energy}}, providing insights into its ability to perform work or undergo changes without relying on external forces. The {{Mechanical Energy}} is structured as the sum of the object's {{kinetic energy}}, associated with its motion, and {{potential energy}}, related to its position within a gravitational or {{conservative}} force field. This structure accounts for both the object's inherent movement and its stored energy potential, allowing for a holistic understanding of its mechanical capabilities.
