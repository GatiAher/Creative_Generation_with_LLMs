  "purpose": "Potential Energy serves as a storage mechanism for energy in an object based on its spatial orientation. It allows the object to store energy that can later be converted into useful work or motion.",
  "mechanism": "Potential Energy is a function of the object's position in a gravitational or electromagnetic field. The higher the object is positioned, the greater its Potential Energy. This stored energy can be released and converted into kinetic energy when the object moves to a lower position."
