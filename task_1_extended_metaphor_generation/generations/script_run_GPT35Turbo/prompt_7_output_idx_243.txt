Just like a map with Scale to guide,
Currency rates help money glide.
Proportionate measurements, accurate and true,
Ensuring consistency in all we do.

From topographic maps to financial trades,
Scale and exchange rates set the grades.
Maintaining ratios, keeping it right,
In maps and money, they shine bright.
