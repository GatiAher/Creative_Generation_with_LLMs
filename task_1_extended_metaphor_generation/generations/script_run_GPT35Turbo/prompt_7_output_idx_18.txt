Like Dwarf Planets orbiting in space,
Or Iron Man soaring in grace,
Both use a method with precision,
To maintain stability, it's their mission.

Gravitational forces or geometric design,
Keeping balance, aligned and fine,
Dwarf Planets and Repulsor Tech share,
A method that shows they truly care.

Whether in the vast cosmic expanse,
Or in battles where heroes dance,
Stability is key, in every way,
To ensure success, come what may.
