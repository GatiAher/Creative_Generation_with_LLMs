      "asteroids": "Gravitational forces play a critical role in interacting with celestial bodies, altering trajectories, and ensuring the stability of planetary systems in the solar system.",
      "pitching_mechanics": "Similarly, in baseball, pitching mechanics rely on forces and movements to interact with the ball, alter its trajectory, and ensure the stability of the pitch for the pitcher and the team."

      "metaphor": "both Asteroids in the solar system and Pitching Mechanics in baseball involve orbital mechanics",
      "asteroids": "Utilizing various orbits to organize celestial objects and influence their positions and interactions is an essential part of managing asteroids in the solar system.",
      "pitching_mechanics": "In baseball, proper pitching mechanics involve various movements and positions to optimize the pitch's trajectory and influence its interactions with the batter and the field, akin to how celestial objects' positions and interactions are influenced by orbital mechanics in the solar system."
