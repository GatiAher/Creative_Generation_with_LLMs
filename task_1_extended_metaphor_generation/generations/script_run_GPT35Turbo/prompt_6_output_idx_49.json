        "purpose": "Black Holes have an event horizon, a point of no return where the gravitational pull becomes so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape.",

        "mechanism": "Similar to the event horizon of Black Holes, the strike zone acts as a boundary that defines the limits of the game; once a ball crosses this boundary, it has a specific outcome, whether a strike or a ball."
