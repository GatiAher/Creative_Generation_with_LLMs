Like a chemical reaction's equilibrium,
The Central Bank maintains stability on a whim.
Balancing points in both realms,
Ensure stability at the helm.

Dynamic equilibrium they uphold,
Adjusting rates, policies, bold.
Reactants and products in sync,
Economic stability is their instinct.

A feedback control system they share,
Monitoring to show they care.
Maintaining balance, steering the ship,
Equilibrium and Central Bank, a perfect partnership.
