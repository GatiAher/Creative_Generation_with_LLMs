Topographic profiles and Kpop choreography,
Both utilize visualization as their key strategy.
With cross-sectional representation and geometric analysis,
They offer clarity and insight, without any bias.

Just as elevation changes are seen on a map,
Dance sequences in Kpop are like a visual trap.
Through geometry and detailed mapping of moves,
Both bring depth and understanding that grooves.
