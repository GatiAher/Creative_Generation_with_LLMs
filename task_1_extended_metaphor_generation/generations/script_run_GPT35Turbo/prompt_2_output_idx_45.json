  "purpose": "Debugging can be compared to troubleshooting a complex geometric shape or mathematical equation, where errors need to be discovered and corrected to achieve the desired result. Just as in engineering, debugging ensures that the final design functions correctly, avoiding potential failures or inaccuracies.",
  "mechanism": "Debugging follows a systematic approach similar to solving a complex mathematical problem. It involves analyzing the program, identifying the sources of errors based on specific patterns or assumptions, and applying corrections step by step until the program behaves as intended. The structure of debugging relies on logical reasoning and testing methodologies to isolate and address issues efficiently."
