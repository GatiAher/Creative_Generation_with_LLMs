Catalysis and Arc Reactors, both alike,
Agents of change, in their own right.
Lowering activation energy, their game,
Speeding up transformations, not the same.

Geometric configurations, they both share,
Structuring catalysts with utmost care.
Smooth paths for reactions, they pave,
Efficiency optimized, their goal to save.
