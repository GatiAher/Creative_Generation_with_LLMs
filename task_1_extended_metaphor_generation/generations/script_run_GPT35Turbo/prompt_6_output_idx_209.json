      "metaphor": "Both Parallel Computing in distributed computing and Pitching Rotation in baseball have the characteristic of 'Divide and Conquer' where they break down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable parts that can be solved independently or simultaneously.",
      "parallel_computing": "In Parallel Computing, the 'Divide and Conquer' approach involves breaking down a large computational task into smaller subtasks that can be processed in parallel by different processors. This speeds up the overall computation.",
      "pitching_rotation": "Similarly, Pitching Rotation in baseball divides the pitching responsibilities among different pitchers in the rotation. Each pitcher is tasked with handling a specific portion of the game, allowing the team to strategically manage pitch counts and utilize various strengths and skills throughout the season."
