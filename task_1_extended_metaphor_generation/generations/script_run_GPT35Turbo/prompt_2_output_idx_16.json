  "purpose": "Biodiversity acts as a measure of the overall complexity and resilience of natural systems, akin to how diversity in mathematical functions leads to more robust solutions. It offers a wider range of potential responses to environmental changes and increases the stability of ecosystems, resembling the role of redundancy in engineering designs.",
  "mechanism": "Biodiversity is structured through the presence of various species, each with unique characteristics suited to different niches within ecosystems. This diversity provides multiple layers of interactions and dependencies among species, similar to the intricate network designs in complex engineering systems. The interwoven relationships enhance ecosystem functions, such as nutrient cycling, pollination, and pest control, promoting overall ecosystem health and function."
