Atmospheric Circulation and Pitching Mound
Both systems, complex and sound
Temperature balance they control
Through engineering they patrol

Heat transport and energy spread
Global scale, they both tread
From equator to poles, air-flowing
Fair game and climate, they're both bestowing

Like wind cells and moisture's aid
Regulating, their role played
In earth's climate and baseball game
Global energy, fair play, the aim.
