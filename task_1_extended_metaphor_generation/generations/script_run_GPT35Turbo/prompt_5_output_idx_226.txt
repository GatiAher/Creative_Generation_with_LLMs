Iron Man's suit modularity, which allows for different components to be partitioned into distinct regions with specific functions for efficient control, modeling, and analysis while structuring the design in a hierarchical manner based on variations in physical properties to facilitate understanding and defining boundary delimitations where key parameters change abruptly for simplified analysis.
