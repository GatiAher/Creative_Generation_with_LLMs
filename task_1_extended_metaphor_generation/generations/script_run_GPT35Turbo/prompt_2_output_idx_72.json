  "purpose": "Subduction Zones act as a natural system for recycling old crust and materials, facilitating the renewal and regeneration of the Earth's surface.",
  "mechanism": "The Subduction Zones are structured like a convergent boundary, where one tectonic plate slides beneath another due to differences in density and composition. This subduction process leads to the destruction and recycling of old crust, allowing for the creation of new landforms and releasing stored energy in the form of seismic activity and volcanic eruptions."
