Just like a program with modularity bright,
And baseball pitcher rotation under the night,
Both structured elements in their design,
Breaking down tasks, in a hierarchal line.

Software modules crafted with care,
Pitchers in rotation, roles to bear,
Focus on specifics, not the whole,
Each part contributes to the goal.

In hierarchy they stand, clear and true,
In software code and baseball's view,
Modularity and hierarchy, hand in hand,
Guiding success, across the land.
