  "purpose": "Continental Drift facilitates positional adjustments of land masses on Earth's surface to optimize geometric configurations and minimize stress within tectonic plates.",
  "mechanism": "The movement of tectonic plates redistributes continents to achieve equilibrium, analogous to a dynamic engineering system where components are rearranged to minimize energy and stress. This process is driven by forces such as mantle convection, causing plates to interact and adjust their positions over time."
