      "metaphor": "both Rate-determining step in chemical kinetics and Comeback schedule in Kpop act as bottlenecks",
      "rate-determining_step": "In chemical kinetics, the rate-determining step serves as a bottleneck that controls the overall reaction rate by regulating the speed at which the slowest step can proceed, thus influencing the efficiency and outcome of the reaction.",
      "comeback_schedule": "Similarly, in Kpop, the Comeback schedule acts as a bottleneck that dictates the timing and pace at which a group can release new music and engage with fans. It ensures that the group's overall success and impact are determined by the careful planning and execution of their comeback strategy."

      "metaphor": "both Rate-determining step in chemical kinetics and Comeback schedule in Kpop act as barriers",
      "rate-determining_step": "The rate-determining step introduces an elevated barrier that significantly slows down a particular step, making it the limiting factor that determines the overall rate of the reaction.",
      "comeback_schedule": "Likewise, the Comeback schedule sets up barriers in the form of preparation time, promotional activities, and overall timing to ensure that the comeback is strategically paced and impactful within the Kpop industry."

      "metaphor": "both Rate-determining step in chemical kinetics and Comeback schedule in Kpop act as constraints",
      "rate-determining_step": "In chemical kinetics, constraints limit the rate at which reactants can progress through a mechanism, influencing the overall speed and extent of the reaction.",
      "comeback_schedule": "Similarly, the Comeback schedule imposes constraints on the frequency and timing of comebacks for Kpop groups, influencing how often they can release new music and interact with their audience to maintain interest and relevance in the industry."
