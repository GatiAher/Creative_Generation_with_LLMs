Just like Moons in the sky above,
Pitching mechanics stabilize with love.
Orbital paths and movements true,
Equilibrium in all they do.

In the solar system, Moons provide grace,
Balancing planets in their cosmic place.
Baseball pitchers throw with precision,
Stabilizing their pitch, a pitching division.

Orbital mechanics guide the way,
In celestial dance, Moons sway.
Pitching mechanics, a player's chore,
Ensuring accuracy, a baseball lore.

Equilibrium in both realms found,
Moons and pitchers, on solid ground.
Stable and steady, in motion and throw,
In cosmic dance or on field's row.
