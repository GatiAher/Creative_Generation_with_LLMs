  "purpose": "Rate laws enable engineers to predict and optimize the speed at which reactions occur based on the concentrations of reactants, which is crucial for designing efficient and cost-effective chemical processes.",
  "mechanism": "Rate laws consist of mathematical formulas that establish a relationship between the rate of a reaction and the concentrations of reactants. By studying these mathematical expressions, engineers can assess how changes in reactant concentrations alter the reaction rate, aiding them in making informed decisions to enhance the efficiency and productivity of chemical processes."
