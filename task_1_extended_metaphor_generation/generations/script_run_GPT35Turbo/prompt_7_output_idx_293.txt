Like Mid-Ocean Ridges in plate tectonics,
Expanding leagues in baseball add new dynamics.
Both embody redundancy's wise tactics,
Generating freshness through continuous mechanics.

Just as ridges birth oceanic crust,
New teams breathe life in sports league's dust.
Resilience shown in balance adjust,
Ensuring growth, preventing stagnate rust.
