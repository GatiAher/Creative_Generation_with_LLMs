Energy is like Iron Man, with different components representing various aspects of its functions. Just as Kinetic Energy and the Arc Reactor calculate the energy needed for motion, Potential Energy and Flight technology with repulsor energy store power waiting to be unleashed. Mechanical Energy and the Power Core quantify work capabilities, while Thermal Energy and the ARC REACTOR manage internal dynamics and heat transfer. Lastly, Chemical Energy and the Arc Reactor both embody principles of storage, design, and transformation to release energy when needed. In essence, just like Iron Man harnesses different technologies to power his suit, energy utilizes different forms to fuel the world around us.
