In maps and mounds, lines and shade,
Both landscapes shaped, rules to be obeyed.
Contour lines hand in hand with slopes,
Pitching mound terrain design copes.

Shading techniques, light and dark,
Enhance the visuals, make a mark.
Mound's composition, grip and feel,
Just like maps, details reveal.

In topographic maps and baseball design,
Relief and terrain, intertwined.
Lines and shades, rules and play,
In both worlds, they hold sway.
