{
  "purpose": "Calabi-Yau manifolds act as compact spaces that allow for extra dimensions to be hidden or 'compactified', helping to explain the observed properties of particles and forces in superstring theory.",
  "mechanism": "Calabi-Yau manifolds have a complex geometric structure with specific properties that enable them to curl up or 'compactify' the extra dimensions required by superstring theory, creating a framework for the fundamental building blocks of nature to interact in a unified way."
