Like the pituitary gland in the body's command,
Or pitch framing in baseball land,
Centralized control they both do wield,
Regulating balance on their field.

Feedback loops keep them in check,
Adjusting to maintain the best effect,
Whether hormones or strike calls,
Both play their part in regulating the halls.
