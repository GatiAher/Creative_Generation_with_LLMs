In the polar vortex and Kpop's realm,
Buffer zones and stable layers overwhelm.
Like the Stratosphere shields cold air and controls flow,
Concept Albums in Kpop let creativity grow.

Both have a structure, containment in their core,
Modulating phenomena, influencing more.
The stable layer in the Stratosphere stable and sound,
Concept Albums in Kpop keep narratives bound.

So next time you listen to a Kpop song,
Remember the Stratosphere, where similarities belong.
Both worlds create magic, their elements align,
In polar vortex and Concept Albums, cohesion intertwine.
