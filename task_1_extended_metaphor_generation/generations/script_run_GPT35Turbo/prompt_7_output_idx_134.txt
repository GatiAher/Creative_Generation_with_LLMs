In the world of science and tech so grand,
Lewis Structures and Iron Man's holographic stand.
Both use Visualization with such precision,
Modeling and bonding with great ambition.

Geometric Representation, lines and dots,
In molecular compounds and Iron Man's plots.
Spatial relationships, visually shown,
In 2D format, knowledge is grown.

From molecules to suits, they both analyze,
Structural features with sharp eyes.
Lewis Structures and Iron Man's projection,
Geometry and modeling, a perfect connection.
