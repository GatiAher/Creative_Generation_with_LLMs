Like a double helix in DNA,
Or an arc reactor in Iron Man's display,
Structural redundancy in play,
Ensuring stability come what may.

Efficient use of space they share,
Compact designs beyond compare,
High data density laid bare,
Maximizing potential with flair.

Modularity at their core,
Adaptability to explore,
Easy separation, components galore,
Enhancing functionality, forevermore.
