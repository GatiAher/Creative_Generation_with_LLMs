  "purpose": "The Atmospheric Circulation serves to equalize temperature imbalances across the Earth's surface, regulating heat distribution to maintain a stable climate system.",
  "mechanism": "The Atmospheric Circulation is a complex system driven by the temperature differences between the equator and the poles, resulting in the formation of pressure gradients that induce wind patterns. These wind patterns, such as Hadley, Ferrel, and Polar cells, work to transport heat from the equator towards the poles and vice versa, effectively redistributing thermal energy on a global scale."
