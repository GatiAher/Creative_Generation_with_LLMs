      "metaphor": "Both Kinetic Energy in energy and Pitching velocity in baseball have an energy principle that helps in calculating the work required for moving objects by considering factors like velocity and mass. It enables understanding the energy associated with the motion of objects without direct measurement.",
      "kinetic_energy": "Kinetic energy determines the energy associated with the motion of objects by taking into account the squared value of velocity. Objects with higher velocities or greater mass possess more kinetic energy, reflecting their potential impact.",
      "pitching_velocity": "Similarly, Pitching velocity in baseball determines the speed at which a pitcher hurls the ball towards the batter. It mirrors the concept of kinetic energy by showcasing how the velocity of the pitch influences its impact on the game. A pitcher with higher velocity can potentially strike out more batters or throw more challenging pitches to outmaneuver opponents."
