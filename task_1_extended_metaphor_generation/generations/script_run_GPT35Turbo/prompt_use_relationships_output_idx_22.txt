The endocrine system can be likened to Iron Man, with hormones acting as Repulsor technology that guides crucial processes like growth and metabolism. Just as Hormones maintain communication, Repulsor technology allows seamless integration between suit components. 

The Endocrine Glands function like Jarvis AI Assistant in Iron Man, serving as reliable transmitters in a complex network. Both offer Redundancy and Resilience, providing critical support and disseminating information efficiently. 

The Pituitary Gland and J.A.R.V.I.S. share a Centralized Control, orchestrating various functions for optimal performance. They also employ Feedback Control to fine-tune activities and maintain balance.

The Thyroid Gland and J.A.R.V.I.S. both operate as Feedback Control Systems, adjusting processes to ensure balance and efficiency. They function as Closed-loop Systems, monitoring levels and making real-time adjustments.

Lastly, the Adrenal Glands and J.A.R.V.I.S. use Feedback Control mechanisms to respond dynamically to stressors. Equipped with a Sensor-Actuator System, they detect changes and maintain balance through efficient communication strategies.
