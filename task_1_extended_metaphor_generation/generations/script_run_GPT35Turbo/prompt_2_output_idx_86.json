  "purpose": "Angular momentum serves as a measure of how much a rotating object resists changes in its rotational motion. It helps in understanding the distribution of mass and speed in a rotating system, which is crucial for stability and control in various engineering applications.",
  "mechanism": "Angular momentum is a mathematical concept that combines the moment of inertia (a measure of an object's distribution of mass around its axis of rotation) and angular velocity (the rate at which an object rotates around its axis). The product of these two quantities results in the angular momentum, representing the rotational motion of the object. This structure enables engineers and designers to predict and manipulate the behavior of rotating systems by controlling the distribution of mass and speed."
