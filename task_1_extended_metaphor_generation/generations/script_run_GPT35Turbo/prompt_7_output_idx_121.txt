In chemistry's realm where reactions brew,
And on the baseball field where pitchers threw,
Exothermic reactions and pitcher's glove in play,
Both manage heat in a controlled way.

Chemical reactions release heat to maintain,
Optimal performance without a strain,
Just like the glove that catches with ease,
Releasing heat to prevent mishandling disease.

Heat dissipation in a system controlled,
Prevents overheating, keeps the balance bold,
Both in the lab and on the field,
Efficient heat release is the shield.
