      "stratosphere": "The unique structure of the stratosphere in the polar vortex enables it to contain and modulate extreme weather events, such as the polar vortex, by channeling cold air masses and preventing them from spreading uncontrollably.",
      "central_bank": "In a similar manner, the Central Bank's unique structure and tools, such as monetary policy and regulatory measures, allow it to contain and modulate financial phenomena like market crashes and economic downturns, safeguarding the stability of the economy."
