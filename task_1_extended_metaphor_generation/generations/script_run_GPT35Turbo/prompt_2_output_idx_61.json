  "purpose": "The Legend serves as a translator between the symbolic representation and real-world features on the map, bridging the gap for clear interpretation without the need for external references.",
  "mechanism": "The Legend categorizes symbols by type, color, size, and pattern, organizing them in a systematic manner that correlates with corresponding elements on the map. This structured approach ensures a consistent and standardized method of decoding information while aiding in the differentiation and identification of various map features based on their graphical representation."
