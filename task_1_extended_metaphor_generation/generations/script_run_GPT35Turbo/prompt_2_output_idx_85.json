  "purpose": "Impulse acts as a pivotal force multiplier, facilitating the efficient transfer of motion and energy between objects through a strategic application of force over time. It enables the optimization of momentum changes in dynamic systems and supports the controlled acceleration or deceleration of objects in a variety of engineering and design applications.",
  "mechanism": "The Impulse is mathematically defined as the integral of force with respect to time, demonstrating the geometric relationship between force, time, and the resulting change in momentum. This structured approach allows for precise control and manipulation of momentum alterations in a system by varying either the force magnitude or the duration over which the force is applied."
