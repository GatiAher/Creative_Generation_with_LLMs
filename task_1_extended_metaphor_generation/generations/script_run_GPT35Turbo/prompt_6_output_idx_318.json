      "metaphor": "both Kinetic Energy in energy and Arc Reactor in Iron Man have an energy principle that helps in calculating the work required for moving objects by considering factors like velocity and mass. It enables understanding the energy associated with the motion of objects without direct measurement.",
      "kinetic_energy": "Kinetic energy determines the energy associated with the motion of objects by taking into account the squared value of velocity. Objects with higher velocities or greater mass possess more kinetic energy, reflecting their potential impact.",
      "arc_reactor": "The Arc Reactor in Iron Man serves as a source of power that powers the Iron Man suit and technology. It functions by generating and harnessing energy from a clean and efficient source, similar to how kinetic energy reveals the energy possessed by moving objects through calculations based on velocity and mass."
