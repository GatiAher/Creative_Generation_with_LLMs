Just as the Jet Stream's dynamic boundary
Separates air masses with weather's harmony,
So does the Foreign Exchange Market in money,
Creating a separation of currencies, so dandy.

Both Jet Stream and Market, energy they hold,
Concentrating momentum over distances untold,
Driving weather systems and financial exchanges bold,
Regulating global patterns, stories yet untold. 

High winds of change, in both realms they arise,
Along Jet Stream boundaries, in money's highs,
Contributing to regulation, in earth and skies,
Jet Stream and Market, where regulation lies.
