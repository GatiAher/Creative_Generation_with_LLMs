Exothermic reactions and Arc Reactors,
Both focus on thermal management with creators.
One releases heat for stability and performance,
The other converts energy into heat with brilliance.

Both involve dissipating excess heat,
Controlling temperatures for systems to beat.
Chemical reactions and Iron Man's tech,
Efficiently managing heat, a powerful deck.
