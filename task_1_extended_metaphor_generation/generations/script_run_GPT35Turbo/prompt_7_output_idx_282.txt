Like a volcanic vent beneath the earth's crust,
Or Iron Man's repulsor-based thrust,
Both focus on pressure release in kind,
With geometric design that is aligned.

The magma flows through a narrow path,
While energy in Iron Man's suit does flash,
Controlled release to prevent destruction,
Efficient and effective in their construction.
