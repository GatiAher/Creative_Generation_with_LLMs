In the cosmos of creation, 
And on baseball's field of sensation,
Inflation and expansion stand in correlation,
Both aiming for uniformity and flat spacetime formation.

Like the big bang's rapid start,
Or baseball adding teams with heart,
Exponential growth plays its part,
Ensuring balance from the very start.
