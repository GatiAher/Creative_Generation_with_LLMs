  "purpose": "The Planets act as dynamic components within the solar system, contributing to its overall gravitational equilibrium and ensuring stability through their precise geometric positions and movements.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of the Planets involves each planetary body following a specific elliptical path around the Sun, dictated by mathematical principles such as Kepler's laws of planetary motion and Newton's law of universal gravitation. This structured setup allows for the maintenance of a harmonious design where the gravitational interactions between the Planets and the Sun result in stable orbital configurations."
