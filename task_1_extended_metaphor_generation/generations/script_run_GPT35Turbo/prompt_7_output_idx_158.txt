In chemical reactions or in Iron Man's suit,
A bottleneck mechanism controls the pursuit.
Just like the slowest step in kinetics' fate,
Repulsor tech limits Iron Man's rate.

With barriers high and constraints in place,
Both face limits they cannot erase.
The rate-determining step and tech's own design,
Impose restrictions, making progress align.

So whether in chemistry or superhero's quest,
Bottleneck mechanisms put efficiency to the test.
A barrier, a constraint, a limit clear,
Determining the speed, making the outcome near.
