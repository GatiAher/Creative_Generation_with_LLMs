"""{{Mid-Ocean Ridges}} facilitate the expansion of the Earth's crust by forming new oceanic crust at the diverging boundaries of {{tectonic plates}}, allowing for the redistribution of the Earth's surface materials. {{Mid-Ocean Ridges}} are linear features where {{tectonic plates}} move apart, creating a gap that allows {{magma}} from the mantle to rise and solidify, forming new oceanic crust. This mechanism helps maintain the balance of the Earth's crust by continuously generating new {{lithosphere}} at the diverging plate boundaries."""
