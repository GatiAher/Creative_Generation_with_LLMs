Like catalysts in chemical reactions, 
And choreography in Kpop, 
Optimization and simplification are key,
To enhance performance without a stop.

They streamline pathways with precision,
Adjust movements for visual delight,
Recalibrating energy barriers with vision,
Creating dance routines that shine bright.
