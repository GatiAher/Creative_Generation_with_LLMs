Like endocrine glands in our body's system,
Collaborations between Kpop idols bring wisdom.
Both with redundancy, they function in sync,
Spreading messages, connecting hearts with a link.

Resilient and strong, they stand firm and true,
Endocrine glands and Kpop collabs continue.
Nodes in a grid, they reach where they must,
Bridging gaps, creating art, gaining trust.

Efficiency shines in their every move,
Delivering messages, sharing talent to prove.
Endocrine glands and Kpop collabs combine,
Creating magic, in harmony they align.
