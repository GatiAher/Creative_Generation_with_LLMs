In the realm of energy and Iron Man's might,
Chemical Energy and Arc Reactor shine bright.
With Storage and Release, they both align,
Storing and releasing energy in design.

Structured with care, atoms and molecules they bind,
The Structural Design Principle in them we find.
From potential to kinetic, they transform with grace,
The Transformation Principle they both embrace.

Like a well-oiled machine, they work in harmony,
Chemical Energy and Arc Reactor, a perfect analogy.
