The Stratosphere in polar vortex,
And Iron Man's repulsor tech,
Both with buffer zones that protect and confine,
Containing forces, keeping chaos in check.

Stable layers above the troposphere,
Influencing temperature and wind,
Stratosphere and repulsor technology,
Creating equilibrium, maintaining control within.

A unique structure for containment and modulation,
Regulating atmospheric phenomena with precision,
Stratosphere and Iron Man's technology,
Adjusting and controlling, shaping the environment's condition.
