Like layers in the sky and blocks in finance,
Both with modularity, a defining stance.
Hierarchical structures, organized fine,
Boundaries in place, a clear design.

Just as atmospheric layers partition the air,
Blockchain divides transactions with care.
Temperature and composition, or money flow,
Both systems create order, this we know.
