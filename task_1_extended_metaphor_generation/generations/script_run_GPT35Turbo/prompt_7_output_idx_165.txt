Algorithms in code, like a baseball pitch sequence,
Break down complex tasks with a structured ease.
Math and patterns guide the way,
In well-defined steps they both play.

Pitch by pitch, a strategic game,
Outwitting batters, not the same.
Structured approach to win the bout,
In algorithms and baseball, there's no doubt.
