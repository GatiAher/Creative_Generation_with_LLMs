APIs can be compared to different forms of money in the digital landscape. RESTful API is like Digital currency, promoting modularity by dividing functionality into smaller, independent modules accessed through defined interfaces. Similarly, SOAP API is like Cryptocurrency, acting as a precise blueprint that outlines dimensions and structures. And just as GraphQL API is like Cryptocurrency, employing the Single Responsibility Principle to specify data and requirements efficiently, RPC API is like Blockchain, decomposing complex systems into manageable parts for effective communication and collaboration. In essence, APIs, like money, serve as versatile tools for transactions and data exchange, each with their unique characteristics and functions in the digital economy.
