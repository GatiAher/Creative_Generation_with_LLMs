Habitats and Kpop dances intertwine,
Design principles of geometric optimization align.
Efficient resource utilization they both endorse,
Creating interconnected patterns, complex network designs of course.

Just like organisms in ecosystems thrive,
Kpop dancers through choreography strive.
Maximizing space and energy with precision,
Creating dynamic performances that capture vision.
