  "purpose": "The Plate Boundaries serve as interfaces where tectonic plates come into contact, facilitating the exchange and redistribution of forces, energy, and material within the Earth's lithosphere. These interactions contribute to the dynamic behavior of the Earth's crust.",
  "mechanism": "The Plate Boundaries are structured as distinct boundaries between different tectonic plates, including convergent boundaries where plates move towards each other, divergent boundaries where plates move away from each other, and transform boundaries where plates slide past each other horizontally. These diverse structures accommodate various geological activities, such as subduction, seafloor spreading, and seismic activity."
