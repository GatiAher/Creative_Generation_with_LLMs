In the world of computing and on the baseball field,
Concurrency and pitchers in rotation yield,
Like synchronized dance partners or a well-oiled machine,
They work seamlessly together, a parallelism scene.

Each task runs independently, maximizing their resource,
Just as pitchers take turns, their skills in full force,
Shared efficiently like a potluck feast,
They bring their strengths together, a resource sharing beast.

Non-blocking design keeps the flow smooth,
In a bustling city or on the pitcher's mound groove,
No congestion or hindrance, just continuous play,
Concurrency and rotations, in harmony they sway.
