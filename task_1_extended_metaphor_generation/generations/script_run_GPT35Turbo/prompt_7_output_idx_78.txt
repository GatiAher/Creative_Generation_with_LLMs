Chromosomes and Arc Reactor, both in their own way,
Serve as blueprints with structure and array.
Efficiently storing and organizing with care,
Maximizing space and resources to share.

Complex proteins in both systems work,
Coordinating functions, never a quirk.
From genetic material to energy flow,
These architectural blueprints, they truly show.
