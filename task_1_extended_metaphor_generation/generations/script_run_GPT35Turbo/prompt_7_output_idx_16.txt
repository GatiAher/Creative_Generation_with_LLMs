Like dwarf planets in space and Kpop choreography,
Both rely on gravitational stabilization to prevent entropy.
With objects in orbits and dancers in lines,
They use mass and movement to create designs.

Geometric structuring is their common thread,
With spatial arrangements ensuring harmony instead.
In celestial bodies and dance routines,
Precision and patterns create aesthetic scenes.

So whether in the cosmos or on stage,
Stability and structure define their sage.
Dwarf planets and choreography, hand in hand,
Creating order in chaos, as they both command.
