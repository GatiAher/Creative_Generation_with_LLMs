Like Endothermic Reactions in chemistry, 
Money Stability relies on external energy.
Just as heat is absorbed for chemical stability,
Financial stability requires outside synergy.

Heat transfer between surroundings and system,
Brings changes to maintain balance within.
In money, external factors provide the momentum,
To ensure stability and secure financial win.
