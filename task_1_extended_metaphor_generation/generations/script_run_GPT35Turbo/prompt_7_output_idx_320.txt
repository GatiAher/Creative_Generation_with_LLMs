In Kpop's dance, we see a similarity,
To potential energy, in its choreography.
Just as energy's stored in spatial schemes,
Dancers store movements in powerful themes.

Like gravitational potential, their positions matter,
Higher placements bring energy, their performances scatter.
From potential to kinetic, the energy is released,
Transitions to lower positions, movements unleashed.

Both dance and physics share a common thread,
In Kpop's choreography, energy is fed.
Stored and released, in movements they display,
Potential energy in dance, in a similar way.
