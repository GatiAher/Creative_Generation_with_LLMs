      "metaphor": "both Distributed Systems in distributed computing and Collaboration between Kpop group members in Kpop have Division of Tasks by dividing tasks among different entities",
      "distributed_systems": "In Distributed Systems, Division of Tasks involves breaking down complex computations or processes into smaller, manageable tasks distributed among different nodes to improve efficiency and performance.",
      "collaboration_between_kpop_group_members": "Similarly, in Kpop groups, Division of Tasks is seen when each member is assigned specific roles such as lead vocalist, main dancer, or rapper, contributing to the overall harmony and success of the group."
