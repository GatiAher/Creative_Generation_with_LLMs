Like a computer program and J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man,
Both structured with syntax and rules to plan.
Programming languages and AI system align,
Using symbols and conventions to define the design.

Just as coders rely on a consistent set,
To convey commands without any fret.
Tony Stark communicates with his creation,
Through a set of symbols, ensuring precision. 

In the realm of technology, the analogy stands tall,
Programming and AI, interconnected like a digital sprawl.
