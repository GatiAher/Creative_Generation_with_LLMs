In the vast cosmic dance, 
Event Horizon and Repulsor Shield prance,
Boundaries geometrically designed,
Capturing all within their gravitational bind.

One-way barriers, no escape in sight,
Severe spacetime curvature, bending light,
Defined by math, a radius derived,
Marking the limit of influence described.

Black holes and Iron Man, worlds apart,
Yet their boundaries, a mirror to their heart,
Analogies in theory and fiction laid,
Infinite power within their boundaries displayed.
