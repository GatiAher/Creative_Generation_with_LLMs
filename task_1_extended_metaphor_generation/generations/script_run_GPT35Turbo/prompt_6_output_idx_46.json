It acts as a definitive marker of the black hole's influence.",
      "repulsor_shield": "Similarly, the Repulsor Shield in Iron Man serves as a barrier that establishes a physical boundary, capturing all matter and energy within its field. It prevents anything from escaping its gravitational pull, mirroring the behavior of the Event Horizon in theory."

      "event_horizon": "The Event Horizon functions as a barrier that traps all matter and energy within the gravitational pull of a black hole. It ensures that nothing can escape the immense force of the black hole, containing everything within its reach.",
      "repulsor_shield": "Likewise, the Repulsor Shield serves as a protective barrier in Iron Man's suit, capturing all incoming threats and energy within its field. It prevents anything from exiting beyond a certain point, much like the Event Horizon captures all matter and energy within its gravitational pull."

This radius signifies the point at which the gravitational pull becomes so strong that even light cannot escape, representing the limit of the black hole's influence.",
      "repulsor_shield": "In a similar fashion, the Repulsor Shield is designed based on mathematical calculations to create a protective barrier at a specific radius from Iron Man's core. This radius dictates the distance at which the shield can capture threats and energy, reflecting the precision and calculation involved in determining the shield's operational range."

      "event_horizon": "As the mass of a black hole increases, the curvature of spacetime becomes more severe, leading to an escape velocity that exceeds the speed of light. This severe spacetime curvature creates a one-way boundary at the Event Horizon, where nothing can escape the black hole's gravitational pull.",
      "repulsor_shield": "Similarly, the Repulsor Shield relies on severe spacetime curvature within its field to establish a one-way boundary that prevents anything from exiting beyond a certain point. This curvature ensures that any threat or energy captured by the shield remains contained within its protective confines."
