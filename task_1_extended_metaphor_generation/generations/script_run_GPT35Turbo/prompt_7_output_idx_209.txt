In diamonds or circuits, division is key,
Both in pitching rotations and parallel CPUs we see.
Break down the task, conquer in parts,
Speed up the process, in parallel hearts.

Collaboration is key, in both fields alike,
Specialists working together, results take flight.
Harnessing power, of entities combined,
Speeding up processes, in sync aligned.
