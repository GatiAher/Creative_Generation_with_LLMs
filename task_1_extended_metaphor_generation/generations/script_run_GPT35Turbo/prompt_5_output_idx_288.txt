Concept of Collaborations

The concept of collaborations in Kpop involves artists from different groups or solo artists coming together to work on projects, songs, or performances. This feature satisfies the spec requirements as it involves utilizing natural processes (different artists coming together), structuring systems to allow one component to slide beneath another (artists merging their styles and talents), and the process leading to the creation of new content and opportunities for both artists involved.
