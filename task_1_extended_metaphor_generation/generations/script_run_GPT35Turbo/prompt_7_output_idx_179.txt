In the realm of coding and finance's domain,
Structures and rules in place, a clear pathway to gain.
Like programming languages with syntax so precise,
Digital banking follows suit, a structured device.

Standardized symbols in the language of code,
Convey complex algorithms on which programs can erode.
Similarly, in digital banking, symbols and codes in play,
Exchange of information in a standardized array.

Commands consistent, in both worlds they reign,
Logical sequences of actions, in harmony they maintain.
For programming languages and digital banking to thrive,
A systematic approach, the key to keep them alive.
