Catalysts and Blockchain, alike in design,
Optimize and simplify, in their prime.
Facilitating faster pathways, enhancing efficiency,
Recalibrating energy barriers with precision.

Redesigning complex systems, a streamlined route they pave,
Achieving optimal performance, minimal resources they save.
Both Catalysts in chemistry, Blockchain in money,
Optimization and simplification, their principles, so sunny.
