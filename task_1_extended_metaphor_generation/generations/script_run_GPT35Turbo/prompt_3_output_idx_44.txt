"""{{Programming Languages}} serve as the blueprints and formulas that guide the computer in executing specific tasks, similar to how architectural plans direct the construction of a building. {{Programming Languages}} are structured with syntax and rules that resemble mathematical equations, providing a precise way to communicate instructions to the computer. Just as {{engineering drawings}} use standardized symbols and conventions to convey complex information to builders, {{Programming Languages}} rely on a consistent set of symbols and commands to convey logical sequences of actions to the computer."""
