Just like the pituitary gland in our body's control center,
BigHit Entertainment in Kpop acts as a network mentor.
Both oversee and regulate with precision and care,
Maintaining balance and success in their respective lair.

Monitoring closely and adjusting as needed,
They exhibit feedback control, always staying seeded.
Adapting to trends and signals in their domain,
Ensuring sustained relevance and growth remain.
