In Kpop's realm, concept albums unfold,
Like Calabi-Yau spaces, complex and bold.
Hidden dimensions and themes compactified,
In intricate structures, beauty personified.

Just as strings vibrate in hidden domains,
Music and geometry intertwined, it remains.
Calabi-Yau and Kpop, in parallel they align,
Compact spaces and structures, a fusion divine.
