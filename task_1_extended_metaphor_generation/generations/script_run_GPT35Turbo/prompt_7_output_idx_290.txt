In Earth's crust and Iron Man's vest,
Systems of renewal, both manifest.
Subduction Zones and Arc Reactor's might,
Recycling old to forge the new light.

Plates converge, components align,
One slides beneath, a process divine.
From ocean depths to mantle's core,
Renewal cycles, forevermore.

Energy harnessed, technologies merge,
Arc Reactor's power, Iron Man's surge.
Old resources transformed anew,
Subduction's dance, creation true.
