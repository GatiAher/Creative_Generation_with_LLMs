In chemistry's reactions and baseball's pitch,  
Conservation and energy never switch.  
Just as products in reactions stay the same,  
Pitchers in their mechanics play the game.  

Kinetics and thermodynamics guide the way,  
In both fields, they have a say.  
Controlling rates and direction too,  
Ensures the best outcomes through and through.
