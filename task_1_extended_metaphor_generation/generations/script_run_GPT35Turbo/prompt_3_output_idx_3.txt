"""{{Comets}} serve as messengers that travel in elongated paths around the Sun to bring valuable information about the outer regions of the solar system. {{Comets}} are composed of icy materials and dust particles, forming a nucleus surrounded by a coma and a tail. The elongated orbit of a {{Comet}} is determined by the gravitational forces acting upon it, causing it to follow a highly eccentric path around the Sun."""
