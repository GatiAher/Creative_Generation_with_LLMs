Like a volcano's eruption, or Kpop's concept release,
Both serve as mechanisms for internal pressure release.
They structure the system for materials to vent,
Guiding the flow in a controlled descent.

Conduit formation beneath the surface,
Allows for materials to rise and surface.
The pressure builds, seeking a way out,
Creating a pathway for expression, no doubt.

Whether magma and gas or artistic ideas,
The conduit forms to release what's inside of us.
Preventing explosions, building a connection,
Volcanic eruptions and concept releases, both a natural reflection.
