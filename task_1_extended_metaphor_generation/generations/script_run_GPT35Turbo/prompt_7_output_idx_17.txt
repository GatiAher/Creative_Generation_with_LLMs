Like Dwarf Planets in space,
And the Pitcher's mound in place,
Both stabilize with gravitational might,
Ensuring balance and accuracy are just right.

Geometric structuring they share,
In positions strategic and flair,
Creating stability in their own ways,
Guiding movements, ensuring precision stays.
