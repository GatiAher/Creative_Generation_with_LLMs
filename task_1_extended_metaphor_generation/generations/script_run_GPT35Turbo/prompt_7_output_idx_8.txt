Just as asteroids in space move with grace,
Kpop choreography also finds its place.
Gravitational forces keep them in line,
Creating harmony, balance divine.

Orbital mechanics guide their path,
In celestial orbits or dancer's craft.
Patterns and formations in perfect sync,
Like celestial bodies in cosmic link.
