      "metaphor": "both Magma in volcano and MV (Music Video) in Kpop have buoyancy",
      "magma": "Magma harnesses the principle of buoyancy by creating a less dense reservoir that experiences upward force, allowing it to rise towards the surface due to buoyant forces. This movement is crucial for volcanic eruptions and the creation of new landforms.",
      "mv_(music_video)": "Similarly, MVs in Kpop leverage the concept of buoyancy by creating visually captivating content that rises through the ranks of popularity due to the upward force of fan engagement. This buoyant quality propels Kpop MVs to the surface of the music industry, making them stand out and capture attention."

      "metaphor": "both Magma in volcano and MV (Music Video) in Kpop have heat transfer",
      "magma": "Magma facilitates heat transfer through its structural design that allows heat to be carried from the mantle to the crust. This process fuels volcanic activity and contributes to the dynamic nature of Earth's geology.",
      "mv_(music_video)": "Similarly, MVs in Kpop enable heat transfer by carrying the essence and energy of the music from the artists to the audience. The structural design of Kpop MVs ensures that the heat of the performance is conveyed effectively, igniting passion and excitement among viewers."

      "metaphor": "both Magma in volcano and MV (Music Video) in Kpop have material transport",
      "magma": "Magma achieves material transport through its ability to flow and carry substances from the mantle to the crust. This transportation of materials leads to the formation of new land features and shapes the ever-changing landscape of the Earth.",
      "mv_(music_video)": "Similarly, MVs in Kpop excel in material transport by conveying various elements such as fashion, choreography, storytelling, and music itself to the audience. This transportation of artistic materials shapes the landscape of Kpop culture, creating new trends and leaving a lasting impact on the industry."
