Impulse in motion, compound interest in wealth,
Both share a trait of optimization and stealth.
Efficient transfer of energy, controlled acceleration,
Integration and manipulation, a mathematical equation.

Like a force applied strategically, like interest compounding,
Creating change in motion, financial growth surrounding.
Geometric relationships, cumulative effects displayed,
In momentum and money, control and growth are made.
