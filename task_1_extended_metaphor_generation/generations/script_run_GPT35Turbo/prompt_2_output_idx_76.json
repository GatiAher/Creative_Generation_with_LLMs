  "purpose": "Stable Isotope Analysis serves the purpose of investigating the geometric configurations and quantitative relationships of isotopic elements within a sample. By visualizing these isotopic compositions in a mathematical context, it offers insights into the underlying engineering principles and design principles governing geological phenomena.",
  "mechanism": "Stable Isotope Analysis operates by utilizing the principles of mathematical modeling and geometric analysis to quantify the proportions of stable isotopes present in a given sample. This structured approach helps in identifying patterns, correlations, and anomalies in the isotopic data, allowing for the precise interpretation of geological processes and the design of predictive models."
