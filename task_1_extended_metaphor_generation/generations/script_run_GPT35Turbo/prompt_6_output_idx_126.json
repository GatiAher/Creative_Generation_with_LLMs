      "metaphor": "both Endothermic Reaction in chemical reaction and Arc Reactor in Iron Man have similarities in consuming heat energy from surroundings to facilitate changes in internal system configuration",
      "endothermic_reaction": "Endothermic reactions require heat energy from the surroundings to drive the reaction forward and cause changes in the internal chemical configuration. By consuming heat energy, these reactions can proceed and alter the system's composition.",
      "arc_reactor": "Likewise, the Arc Reactor in Iron Man consumes heat energy from its environment to power the suit and make adjustments to the internal system configuration. This heat transfer process enables the Arc Reactor to optimize its functionality and adapt to different situations."
