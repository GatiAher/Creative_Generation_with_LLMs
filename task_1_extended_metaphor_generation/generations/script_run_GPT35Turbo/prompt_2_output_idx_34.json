  "purpose": "Molecular Geometry serves the purpose of optimizing the spatial arrangement of atoms in a molecule for efficient interactions and stability.",
  "mechanism": "The Molecular Geometry is structured based on mathematical principles such as symmetry and spatial angles. By positioning atoms strategically in 3D space, Molecular Geometry helps minimize repulsion forces and maximize attractive forces, contributing to the overall stability and reactivity of the molecule."
