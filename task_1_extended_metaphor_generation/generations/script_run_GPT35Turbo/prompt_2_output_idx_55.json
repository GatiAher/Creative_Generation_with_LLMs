  "purpose": "The purpose of the Composition of the Atmosphere is to create a balanced mixture of gases that supports life on Earth by maintaining suitable conditions for various biological and chemical processes.",
  "mechanism": "The Composition of the Atmosphere is like a well-designed system of multiple components in specific proportions, akin to a geometric structure with different elements contributing to the overall stability and functionality. The presence of gases like oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and others, in their specified ratios, creates a harmonious environment necessary for sustaining life forms and facilitating essential processes. The balanced arrangement of gases ensures that the atmosphere can efficiently regulate temperature, absorb solar radiation, and protect the Earth's surface by filtering harmful ultraviolet rays."
