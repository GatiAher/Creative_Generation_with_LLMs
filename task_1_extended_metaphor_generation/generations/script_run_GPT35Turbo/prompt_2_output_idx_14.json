  "purpose": "The Food Chain functions as a networked system that efficiently transfers energy and resources from one point to another in an ecosystem, akin to a well-designed network architecture optimizing data flow.",
  "mechanism": "It is structured hierarchically, with each level representing a trophic level that contributes to the overall energy flow in the ecosystem. This tiered architecture ensures a clear direction of energy transfer, much like a well-engineered pipeline system moving resources from source to destination."
