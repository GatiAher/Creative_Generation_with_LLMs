In the game of baseball, like an API so true,
Pitch selection is just like RPC, through and through.
Decomposition breaks it down, piece by piece,
Optimizing performance, making strategies increase.

Abstraction in both, simplifies the way,
Communicating clearly in what they convey.
From geometric designs to pitching coordination,
RPC and baseball share this abstraction.

Modularity ties them, like a unified thread,
Interconnected components, working together instead.
From specialized measurements to interchangeable pitch types,
Both systems rely on modularity's delights.
