In Kpop's explosive choreography dance,
Like chemical energy's atomic romance.
Both tightly choreographed, they keep in store,
Potential energy, ready to outpour.

Structural design, intricate formations,
In Kpop's performance, stunning creations.
Just like in chemical energy's compounds,
Careful arrangement, energy abounds.

Transformation principle, energy forms converted,
In Kpop's moves, energy exerted.
Chemical reactions, potential to kinetic,
Both principles, energy's magic.
