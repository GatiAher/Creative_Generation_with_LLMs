Like a singularity in the Big Bang Theory,
Compressing matter to infinite density with clarity.
Just like the Arc Reactor in Iron Man,
Compressing energy to power his plan.

Both lay a foundation strong and true,
Allowing for the unfolding of all that's new.
From universe formation to Iron Man's tech,
These foundations establish and project.

And in structuring, they both excel,
Organizing space-time and energy well.
From the starting point of expansion to Iron Man's actions,
Their structuring abilities lead to satisfactions.
