"""The {{Products}} serve the function of creating new substances through a process of rearranging {{molecular structures}}, leading to the generation of innovative materials and compounds. The structure of the {{Products}} is based on the {{geometric}} arrangement of atoms and molecules, where bonds are broken and formed to create a different configuration. This process follows {{mathematical}} principles of conservation of mass and energy, and {{engineering}} principles of reaction kinetics and thermodynamics to ensure the formation of stable and desired end products. {{Design}} aspects consider the molecular geometries and spatial arrangements that influence the reactivity and selectivity of the chemical reaction to produce the intended {{Products}}."
