  "purpose": "Reactants play a vital role in initiating a transformation process by providing the necessary starting materials for a chemical reaction to occur.",
  "mechanism": "The Reactants are structured in a way that their molecular geometry and arrangement enable them to interact and collide effectively to facilitate the conversion into new chemical products. This geometric arrangement ensures that the reactants have the required energy and orientation for the reaction to progress smoothly."
