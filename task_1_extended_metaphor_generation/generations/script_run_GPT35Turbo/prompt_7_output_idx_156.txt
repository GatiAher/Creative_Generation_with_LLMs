Like a bottleneck in chemical kinetics,
Or a barrier in Kpop rhythms,
The rate-determining step and comeback schedule,
Both serve as constraints and limitations.

Controlling the pace of reactions,
Or dictating the timing of music releases,
They shape the outcomes and success,
By setting boundaries and regulating processes.
