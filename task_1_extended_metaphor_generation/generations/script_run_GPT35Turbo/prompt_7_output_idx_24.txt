Just like the Big Bang's expansive surge,
Inflation Theory and Kpop's Hallyu Wave converge.
Exponential growth with energy fields at play,
Smoothing out boundaries in a uniform way.

The cosmos and culture both seek harmony,
Through fundamental principles and marketing synergy.
From spacetime to landscapes, they both engineer,
A more connected world, crystal clear.
