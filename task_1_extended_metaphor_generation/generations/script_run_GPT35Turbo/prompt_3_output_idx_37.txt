"""{{Reaction rate}} provides insights into the efficiency and effectiveness of a {{chemical process}}, helping engineers optimize the design of reactors and control systems. The {{Reaction rate}} is mathematically modeled using concepts from differential equations and {{chemical kinetics}}. Engineers use rate equations to predict the speed of reactions under different conditions, enabling them to design reactors with optimal [geometry] and size for desired reaction outcomes."""
