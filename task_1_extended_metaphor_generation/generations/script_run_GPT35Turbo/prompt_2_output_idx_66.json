  "purpose": "The Stratosphere acts as a buffer zone above the troposphere, helping to contain and control the polar vortex which is crucial for regulating global climate and weather patterns.",
  "mechanism": "The Stratosphere is positioned above the troposphere, creating a stable layer where changes in temperature and wind patterns influence the formation and behavior of the polar vortex. The unique structure of the Stratosphere allows for the containment and modulation of this powerful atmospheric phenomenon."
