In ecosystems and tech alike,  
Systems integrated, a network to strike.  
Biome and blockchain, a harmonious blend,  
Interdependent parts, on which all depend.  

Efficiency and resilience, key designs,  
Adaptations made, for stability's signs.  
Organisms thrive, in niches they know,  
Blockchain evolves, to resist any blow.  

So as nature's biomes and tech's blockchain play,  
Both systems show strength in their own special way.
