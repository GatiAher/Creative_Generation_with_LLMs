In chemistry's dance and baseball's play,
Equilibrium and pitcher's mound hold sway.
Balancing points, stability found,
In chemical reactions and pitches profound.

Dynamic equilibrium, a principle shared,
Both systems adjust, showing they cared.
Constantly balancing, rates in check,
Maintaining stability, no room for a wreck.

Feedback control, a system so wise,
In chemistry and baseball, it applies.
Adjusting processes to maintain the score,
Equilibrium and pitcher's mound, forevermore.
