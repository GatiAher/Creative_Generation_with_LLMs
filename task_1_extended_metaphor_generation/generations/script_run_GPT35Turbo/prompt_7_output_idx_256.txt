Like a polar vortex in motion,
Or a concept album's devotion,
Regulating themes tie it all together,
Positive and negative phases, like changing weather.

Strength variation, a crucial tool,
Intensity and impact, like a powerful jewel,
Just like the Arctic Oscillation's sway,
Concept albums guide us through a musical display.
