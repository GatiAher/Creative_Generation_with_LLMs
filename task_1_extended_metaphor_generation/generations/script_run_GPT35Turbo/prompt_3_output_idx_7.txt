"""The purpose of the Singularity is to represent a point in space-time where matter is compressed to infinite density, allowing for the initiation of the universe in a highly concentrated state that eventually expands according to the laws of {{physics}}. The Singularity is structured as a point in space-time characterized by infinite density, which serves as the starting point for the expansion of the universe. This highly compressed state creates a foundation from which the laws of {{physics}} and {{geometry}} can unfold, leading to the formation of the universe as we know it."""
