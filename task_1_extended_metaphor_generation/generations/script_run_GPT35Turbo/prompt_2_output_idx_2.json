  "purpose": "Asteroids serve as gravitational influencers within the solar system, affecting orbits and providing insight into the early formation of celestial bodies.",
  "mechanism": "The Asteroids are positioned in various orbits around the Sun, forming a belt between Mars and Jupiter. Their small rocky structures create gravitational forces that interact with the larger planets, altering trajectories and influencing the overall stability of the solar system. By studying the composition and distribution of Asteroids, scientists can glean valuable information about the processes that shaped the early solar system and continue to impact its dynamics."
