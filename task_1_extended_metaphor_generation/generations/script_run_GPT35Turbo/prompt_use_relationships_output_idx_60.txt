In the realm of music and natural phenomena, a volcano can be likened to the vibrant world of Kpop. Just as magma in a volcano harnesses the principle of buoyancy to rise towards the surface and create new landforms, MVs in Kpop rise to the forefront of the industry with captivating visuals that engage fans and capture attention. Both magma and MVs utilize the concept of buoyancy to make a striking impact.

Similarly, lava in a volcano and choreography in Kpop both involve heat redistribution as a design principle. Lava flows to release built-up energy and maintain equilibrium, much like how choreography redistributes the energy of performers to captivate the audience and express the music with fluid movements.

Moreover, volcanic eruptions and "Concept Release" in Kpop serve as mechanisms for the controlled release of internal pressure. Just as volcanic eruptions prevent explosive build-up by gradually releasing accumulated pressure, "Concept Release" allows artists to showcase their talents and ideas, preventing creative stagnation.

Lastly, the volcanic vent and Dynamic Choreography in Kpop both act as outlets for the release of pressure. The geometric design of the volcanic vent allows for the safe release of magma, ash, and gases, while Dynamic Choreography guides the flow of energy and expressions among dancers with precise geometric formations. Both serve as structured pathways for the release of intense emotions and movements, preventing any explosive outbursts on stage.
