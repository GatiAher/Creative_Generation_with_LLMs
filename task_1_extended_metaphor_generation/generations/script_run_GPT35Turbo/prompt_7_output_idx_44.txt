Just as a black hole's Event Horizon,
Defines a boundary where light cannot shine,
So too does a Concept Album in Kpop,
Capture all within its thematic line.

Both possess a Barrier Function,
Trapping matter and energy within,
Creating a cohesive narrative,
Where creativity can truly begin.

Mathematically defined like a radius,
Based on specific parameters in play,
These creations exhibit severe curvature,
Guiding us on a one-way pathway.

Event Horizon and Concept Album alike,
With their geometric boundaries so clear,
They shape our understanding and experience,
In ways that continue to steer.
