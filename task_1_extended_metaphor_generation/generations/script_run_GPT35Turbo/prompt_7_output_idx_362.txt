D-branes and Nanotech, like Iron Man's suit,
Are boundaries flexible, vibrating to compute.
In higher dimensions, they both align,
A geometric framework, analyzing the divine.

Strings interact, membranes adapt,
In mathematical spaces, their properties unwrapped.
From superstring theory to Tony Stark's gear,
These analogies hold, crystal clear.

Surfacing boundaries, serving as a guide,
Dynamics of strings, they both provide.
So whether in science or in fiction's realm,
D-branes and Nanotech overwhelm.
