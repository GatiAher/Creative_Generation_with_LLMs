Just as the Jet Stream in polar vortex
Guides weather systems with dynamic force,
So does the Pitching mound in baseball game
Separate players with energy to tame.

Both boundaries hold momentum and might
Transporting elements with precision and flight,
High winds form along these designated lines
Regulating patterns with strength that shines.
