      "metaphor": "both Lewis Structures in molecular compounds and Pitch Visualization in baseball have Visualization and Modeling using visual blueprints to predict and understand spatial arrangement and bonding patterns, enabling precise modeling of interactions and behaviors.",
      "lewis_structures": "Lewis Structures serve as the visual blueprint for understanding the spatial arrangement of atoms and predicting how they bond together. By using lines and dots to represent shared electron pairs, these structures help in visualizing and modeling the interactions within a molecule.",
      "pitch_visualization": "Similarly, Pitch Visualization in baseball involves using mental blueprints to predict the trajectory and movement of a pitched ball. By visualizing the pitcher's grip, arm motion, and release point, batters can anticipate and understand the behavior of the pitch, enabling them to make precise decisions in a split second."

      "metaphor": "both Lewis Structures in molecular compounds and Pitch Visualization in baseball have Geometric Representation indicating atom connections and shared electron pairs using lines and dots for visualizing geometric relationships and electron distributions.",
      "lewis_structures": "In Lewis Structures, lines represent bonds between atoms while dots denote shared electron pairs, providing a geometric representation of the molecule's structure and electron distribution. This visual language helps chemists analyze and interpret the spatial relationships within a compound.",
      "pitch_visualization": "Similarly, Pitch Visualization in baseball utilizes geometric insights to understand the connection between the pitcher's hand positions, release points, and the resulting trajectory of the pitch. This visual representation allows batters to anticipate the angle and movement of the ball, improving their ability to make contact."

      "metaphor": "both Lewis Structures in molecular compounds and Pitch Visualization in baseball have 2D Structural Analysis representing electronic framework of molecules in a 2D format for systematic analysis and manipulation of molecular structures.",
      "lewis_structures": "Lewis Structures provide a 2D representation of the molecular framework, allowing chemists to analyze the electron arrangement and structural patterns of compounds. This format simplifies the manipulation and evaluation of molecular structures in a systematic manner.",
      "pitch_visualization": "In a similar fashion, Pitch Visualization in baseball involves a 2D analysis of the pitcher's movements and the ball's trajectory, enabling batters to strategically analyze the pitch's speed, location, and movement within a two-dimensional plane. This analysis helps batters make split-second decisions on whether to swing or wait for a better pitch."
