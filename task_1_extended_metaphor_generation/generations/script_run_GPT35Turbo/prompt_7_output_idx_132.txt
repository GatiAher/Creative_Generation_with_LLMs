Like Lewis Structures in chemistry,
And Choreography in Kpop, you see,
Both use visualization with precision,
To model interactions and create a vision.

Just as atoms bond in a spatial dance,
Kpop dancers move in sync, taking a chance,
Geometric representation guides their way,
In 2D analysis, they plan and sway.

From molecules to performers on stage,
Visual blueprints set the page,
Lewis Structures predict compounds' fate,
Choreography ensures Kpop's great.
