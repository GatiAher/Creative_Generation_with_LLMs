In the realm of hidden depth and twist,
Calabi-Yau and stadiums coexist.
Compact spaces fold dimensions tight,
Allowing interactions to unite.

From string theory's particles so small,
To baseball's players, fans, and thrall,
Both spaces weave a structure grand,
Where interactions harmoniously stand.
