In software and superheroes, design is key,
With modularity like pieces of a puzzle, we see.
Breaking down tasks into manageable bits,
Enhances flexibility and avoids code that quits.

Hierarchy, too, is a fundamental guide,
Organizing modules with structure and pride.
From powering suits to running programs smooth,
Efficiency and coherence are the goals we choose.
