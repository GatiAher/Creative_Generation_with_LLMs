Like a bottleneck in a chemical reaction,
Or an interest rate in financial transaction,
Both the rate-determining step and interest rate,
Act as barriers constraining the overall fate.

Controlling the speed and outcome in their own right,
Influencing processes, economic activities in sight,
Through barriers and constraints, they dictate the flow,
Determining the pace at which things will go.
