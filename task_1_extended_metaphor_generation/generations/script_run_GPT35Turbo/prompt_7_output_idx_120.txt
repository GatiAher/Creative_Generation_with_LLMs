Just like a chemical reaction's exothermic release,
In Kpop fire performances, energy finds peace.
Both convert one form of energy into heat, 
Ensuring systems and performers stay neat. 

Efficient thermal management is the key,
For optimal performance, it's what we see.
Whether in a lab or on a Kpop stage,
Heat dissipation is all the rage.
