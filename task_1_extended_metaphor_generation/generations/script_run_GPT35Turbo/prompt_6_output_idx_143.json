      "metaphor": "Both Intermolecular Forces in molecular compounds and Diversification in money focus on Stability and Organization as a key principle",
      "intermolecular_forces": "Intermolecular Forces aim to maximize stability and organization within a system by utilizing forces such as dipole-dipole interactions, van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding. These forces facilitate intermolecular interactions and positioning based on energetically favorable configurations.",
      "diversification": "Similarly, Diversification in money aims to maximize stability and organization within an investment portfolio. By spreading investments across different asset classes, regions, and industries, diversification helps ensure efficient packing of assets without altering their individual characteristics directly, just like how Intermolecular Forces ensure efficient packing and arrangement of molecules."
