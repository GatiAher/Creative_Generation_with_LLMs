Like the Scale in maps that guides our way,
And the HUD in Iron Man, without delay,
Both ensure accuracy and consistency,
In measurements and data with utmost efficiency.

Just as the Scale maintains a true ratio,
The HUD keeps Stark in the know,
From distances mapped to real-world dimensions,
Both tools offer precision without apprehensions.

Consistency is key for both Scale and HUD,
Uniform scaling ensures accuracy's flood,
Across maps and screens, they both reign,
In maintaining a reliable scale chain.
