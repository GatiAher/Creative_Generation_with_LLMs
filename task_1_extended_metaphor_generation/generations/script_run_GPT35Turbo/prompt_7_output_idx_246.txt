In maps and Iron Man's HUD we find,
Symbolization and Standardization combined.
Just as legends categorize symbols to see,
HUD aids Tony Stark in decision-making spree.

Standardization ensures consistency clear,
In maps and HUD, information we cheer.
Both designs use principles for interpretation well,
In topographic maps and Iron Man's high-tech shell.
