Nucleotides in DNA, like building blocks of life,
Modular design storing genetic insight.
Blockchain in money, with blocks in sight,
Modularity and security, making transactions right.

Redundancy in structure, DNA's strength,
Ensures robustness in genetic length.
Blockchain in money, distributed ledger's length,
Double-checking transactions, system strength.

Precision in encoding, DNA's code,
Accurate replication for life's ode.
Blockchain in money, with cryptographic mode,
Ensuring secure transactions across the node.
