Plate boundaries and baseball gloves alike,
Interfaces that facilitate energy exchange, day and night.
Like tectonic plates meet at boundaries of geologic might,
Gloves connect player and ball, making plays take flight.

Structures in both create boundaries and define,
Movement and function with clarity and design.
Whether geological forces or baseball's prime,
Organizing components for a purpose divine.

Differentiation in variations, diverse and wide,
From divergent to convergent, the Earth does confide.
Various glove designs, player needs satisfied,
Accommodating styles, enhancing performance with pride.
