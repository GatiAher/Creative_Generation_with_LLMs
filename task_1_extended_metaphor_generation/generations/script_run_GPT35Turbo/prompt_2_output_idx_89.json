  "purpose": "String compactification aims to condense the mathematical framework of strings from a higher-dimensional space into a lower-dimensional space so that it can effectively model and explain the observable universe, similar to simplifying a complex geometric shape to better understand its properties and behavior.",
  "mechanism": "The String compactification achieves this reduction of dimensions from ten to four through a process of folding and rearranging the additional spatial dimensions within a Calabi-Yau manifold or other compact manifolds. This restructuring preserves the essential properties of the original higher-dimensional strings while enabling a more concise representation that aligns with the physical reality we observe, akin to creating architectural blueprints that capture all necessary details in a simplified plan."
