Comets in the sky, pitching on high,
Both guided by forces unseen,
Through gravity's dance and aerodynamics' sigh,
Their paths twist and turn as if in a dream.

In the study of materials, they find their kin,
Icy comets and leather-wrapped spheres,
Analyzing the essence that lies within,
To unlock the secrets their composition clears.

So remember when watching a pitcher's skill,
Or gaze at a comet as it streaks by,
In both, there's a science that gives them their thrill,
Orbital mechanics and material science, soaring high.
