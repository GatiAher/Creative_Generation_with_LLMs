In the realm of tech and sports alike,
Cluster Computing and Pitch Framing take flight.
Divide and Conquer, their common grace,
Breaking tasks down to conquer the race.

Parallel Processing, their next shared skill,
Nodes collaborating to fulfill the will.
In baseball, catchers frame with precision,
Working in parallel to influence decisions.

Load Balancing, the final link,
Distributing work to lighten the brink.
In computing and catching, balance is key,
Optimizing outcomes for all to see.
