  "purpose": "Singularities act as pivotal points where the normal rules of geometry and physics are no longer applicable, serving as crucial markers for extreme physical phenomena.",
  "mechanism": "Singularities are characterized by infinite values of key parameters such as density and gravity, leading to a breakdown in the structured geometric framework of spacetime. This extreme structure supports the purpose by highlighting the limits of the existing mathematical and engineering models, providing insights into the behavior of matter and energy under exceptional conditions."
