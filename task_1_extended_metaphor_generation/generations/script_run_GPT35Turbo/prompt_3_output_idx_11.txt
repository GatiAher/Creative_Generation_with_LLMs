"""The Event Horizon serves as a geometric boundary that marks the limit of the black hole's influence and prevents anything, including light from escaping. It acts as a barrier that captures all matter and energy within the gravitational pull of the black hole, without allowing anything to exit beyond this point. The Event Horizon is structured based on the mathematically defined Schwarzschild radius, which is derived from the mass of the black hole. This radius determines the distance from the singularity at which the gravitational pull becomes so strong that even light cannot overcome it. At the Event Horizon, the curvature of spacetime is so severe that the escape velocity required to overcome the gravitational pull exceeds the speed of light. This [design] creates a one-way boundary that traps everything within the black hole's gravitational field."""
