Momentum is like a Kpop song - once it starts, it's hard to stop. Just like a catchy chorus that gets stuck in your head, linear momentum drives an object forward with a relentless force. It's like a Kpop group's debut single, gaining traction and building excitement as it propels itself through the charts.

Impulse, on the other hand, is like a Kpop idol's sudden rise to fame. It's a powerful force that changes the direction or speed of an object in a short amount of time, much like how a viral dance move or unexpected collaboration can propel an artist to stardom in an instant.

Finally, angular momentum is like a perfectly choreographed performance by a Kpop group. It's the product of an object's rotational motion and its moment of inertia, just like how a group's synchronized dance moves and intricate formations showcase their precision and skill. Just as a Kpop group's momentum can lead to a whirlwind of success, angular momentum can create a dazzling display of artistry and grace.
