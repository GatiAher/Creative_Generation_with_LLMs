  "purpose": "The Double Helix serves as a highly stable and efficient geometric configuration for storing genetic information in a compact manner.",
  "mechanism": "The Double Helix is structured as two intertwined spirals, resembling a twisted ladder. This design allows for a high data density as genetic information is encoded along the length of the strands. The hydrogen bonds between the nucleotide bases hold the two strands together, providing stability while still allowing for easy separation during replication or protein synthesis."
