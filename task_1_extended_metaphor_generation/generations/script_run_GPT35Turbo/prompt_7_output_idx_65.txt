Biodiversity and pitching rotation, a duo so fine,
Redundancy and diversity, intertwined in design.
In ecosystems and baseball, connections run deep,
Resilience and adaptability, the promises they keep.

Layers of interactions, redundancy in place,
Backup mechanisms, a strong defense to embrace.
Multiple pitchers ready, for any game day,
Stability and strength, helping the team sway.

A wider range of responses, diversity at play,
Unique characteristics, guiding the way.
Different strengths and abilities, a diverse set,
Robustness and adaptability, without a single regret.

Interwoven relationships, interconnectedness shines,
Enhancing performance, in complex design.
Collaborative interactions, pitchers in unison,
Success on the field, a tale well-spun.
