Data structures and Jarvis, like a well-constructed home,
Efficient storage and organization, never alone.
Optimizing functionality, a design principle so grand,
Just like a well-planned building, they surely understand.

In computer programs and Iron Man's aid,
Efficiency and structure never fade.
Jarvis, like data structures, functions with grace,
Making decisions swiftly, in his logical space.
