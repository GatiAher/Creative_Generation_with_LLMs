      "relief": "Contour lines in topographic maps create a visual representation of the landscape's height and depth. These lines are spaced based on specific intervals of elevation difference to show changes in terrain steepness and elevation.",
      "pitching_mound_terrain_design": "Similarly, in designing the pitching mound in baseball, the slope and shape of the mound need to follow specific guidelines to ensure fair play. The height and angles of the mound are adjusted to meet regulations, just like contour lines are spaced according to elevation in topographic maps."

      "metaphor": "both Relief in topographic maps and Pitching mound terrain design in baseball have Shading Techniques",
      "relief": "Shading techniques in topographic maps enhance the visualization of terrain features by simulating light and shadow effects based on relative elevations. This helps to differentiate between steep and flat areas on the map.",
      "pitching_mound_terrain_design": "In baseball, the dirt and grass composition on the pitching mound is crafted to provide a suitable grip for the pitcher. The way light and shadow play across the mound can also affect the pitcher's perception and performance. This parallels with shading techniques used in topographic maps to depict different elevations effectively."
