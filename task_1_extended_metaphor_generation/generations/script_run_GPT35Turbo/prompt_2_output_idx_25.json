  "purpose": "The Adrenal Glands function as a feedback controller in the endocrine system, maintaining homeostasis by dynamically responding to external stressors and internal conditions.",
  "mechanism": "The Adrenal Glands are akin to sensors interconnected with actuators, detecting changes in stress levels, metabolism, and blood pressure through specialized geometrical geometrical receptors. This information is processed within its intricate network of glands and pathways resembling a well-engineered feedback loop that regulates hormone production accordingly. The glands\u2019 strategic placement within the body's design allows for efficient communication and rapid response to maintain balance."
