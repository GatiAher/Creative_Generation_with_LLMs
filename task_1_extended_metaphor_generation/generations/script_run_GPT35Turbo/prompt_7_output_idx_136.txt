Just like a choreographer orchestrates the dance,
Molecular Geometry arranges atoms in a trance.
Spatial optimization to enhance stability,
Creating structures with perfect symmetry.

In Kpop, dancers move in synchrony,
While in compounds, atoms bond harmoniously.
Spatial positioning and mathematical symmetry,
Both disciplines strive for perfection diligently.

From the dance floor to the molecular realm,
Spatial optimization and symmetry overwhelm.
In Kpop and compounds, precision is key,
Creating beauty and stability for all to see.
