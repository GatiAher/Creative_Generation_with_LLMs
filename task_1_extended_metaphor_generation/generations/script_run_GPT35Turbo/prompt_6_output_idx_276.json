        "purpose": "The Pressure Release in Volcanic Eruptions is essential for maintaining the stability of the volcano by preventing dangerous build-up of gases and magma.",

        "purpose": "In the realm of Kpop, 'Concept Release' functions similarly by providing a platform for artists to creatively express themselves and release the internal pressure of artistic ideas and talents.",
        "mechanism": "Just like how Volcanic Eruptions allow the escape of pent-up energy through magma and gases, 'Concept Release' allows artists to showcase their talents and ideas to the world, preventing creative stagnation."

        "purpose": "The Structural Design for Eruption ensures that the volcanic materials can flow out smoothly through a designated path, reducing the potential for destructive lateral blasts.",
