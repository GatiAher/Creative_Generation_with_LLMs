  "purpose": "Catalysts serve as optimization algorithms in chemical reactions, facilitating faster reaction pathways and enhancing overall system efficiency without being altered in the process.",
  "mechanism": "Using a geometric and mathematical analogy, Catalysts can be likened to finely tuned tools that alter the activation energy landscape of a reaction by recalibrating the energy barriers and minima. This engineering enables a more streamlined route for the reactants to traverse, akin to redesigning a complex system to achieve optimal performance with minimal resources."
