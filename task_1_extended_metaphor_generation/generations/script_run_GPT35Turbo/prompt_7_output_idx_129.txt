In a game of teamwork, both on the field and in chemistry's bounds,  
Covalent Bonds and Fielding create a secure and collaborative ground.  
Atoms share electrons like players pass the ball with care,  
Building balanced structures, cohesive and rare.  
Just as in baseball, where teamwork is key,  
In molecular compounds, collaboration sets electrons free.
