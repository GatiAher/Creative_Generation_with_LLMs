  "purpose": "Linear momentum serves as a measure of how much movement an object has based on its weight and speed, helping in understanding and predicting the behavior of objects in motion.",
  "mechanism": "The structure of Linear momentum is based on multiplying the mass of an object by its velocity, resulting in a vector quantity that indicates the direction and magnitude of the object's motion. This structure enables engineers and designers to analyze and manipulate the motion of objects in a mathematical and systematic way."
