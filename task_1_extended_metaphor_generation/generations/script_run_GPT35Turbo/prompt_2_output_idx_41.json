  "purpose": "Algorithms are like blueprints for solving complex problems in a logical and efficient manner, much like the architectural plans that guide the construction of a building. They help determine the precise steps needed to achieve a specific goal, whether it's calculating optimal routes or processing data.",
  "mechanism": "Algorithms are structured as a series of well-defined steps or instructions, akin to a detailed recipe that ensures consistent outcomes. By breaking down the problem into smaller and more manageable parts, algorithms use mathematical processes and patterns to guide the design and execution of a solution. This structured approach allows for easy replication and optimization of the problem-solving process."
