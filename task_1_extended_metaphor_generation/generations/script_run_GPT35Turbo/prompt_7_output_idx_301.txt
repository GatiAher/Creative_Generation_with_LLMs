Continental Drift and Player Positioning,
Like engineers with precision designing,
Structural Optimization their core mission,
To minimize stress, achieve the best position.

Equilibrium sought in plate tectonics and field,
Balancing forces, strategic yield,
Rearranging components, adjusting the scene,
In search of balance, where harmony convene.
