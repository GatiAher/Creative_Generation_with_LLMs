  "purpose": "The purpose of Lava is to redistribute heat and pressure from within the Earth's crust to the surface through a fluid medium, promoting a more stable geothermal environment.",
  "mechanism": "Lava is structured as a molten rock that is less dense than the surrounding solid rocks, allowing it to rise and flow through fractures and weak points in the Earth's crust due to the principle of buoyancy. This movement helps to regulate subsurface temperatures, release pent-up pressure, and contribute to the Earth's cooling process."
