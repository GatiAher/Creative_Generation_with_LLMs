Like a chemical reaction or Kpop choreography,
Balancing points and stability are the key,
Just as equilibrium keeps concentrations in check,
Choreography maintains movements with a perfect effect.

Dynamic equilibrium in both is the rule,
Forward and reverse actions must be cool,
Just as in a chemical reaction it's vital,
In Kpop choreography, movements must be a delightful recital.

Feedback control systems in both play a part,
Adjusting processes to ensure a desired start,
Whether in chemistry or on the Kpop stage,
Balance and stability remain all the rage.
