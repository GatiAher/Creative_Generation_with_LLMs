Linear momentum and pitch trajectory,
Both rely on analysis for efficacy.
In momentum and baseball they apply,
To predict and control how objects fly.

With mass and velocity momentum is found,
Direction and magnitude in motion are bound.
In baseball, pitch trajectory is made clear,
By studying release point and spin rate near.

Design principles guide their way,
In analyzing motion, they both sway.
For engineers and designers in motion's grip,
And for baseball players, with pitches to equip.

So whether it's moving objects or a ball in flight,
Analysis and principles shed a guiding light.
In linear momentum and baseball's play,
Motion analysis leads the way.
