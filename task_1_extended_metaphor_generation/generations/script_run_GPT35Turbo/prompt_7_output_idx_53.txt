In ecosystems and on the baseball field,
Integration and interdependence yield
A harmonious system, a cohesive team,
Efficiency and resilience, their shared dream.

Species in a biome, players on a team,
Each with a role, fulfilling a scheme.
Interconnected, relying on one another,
Thriving together, as a unified brother.

Adaptation and cooperation, the keys to thrive,
In nature's design, and in the game's drive.
Efficiently balanced, resiliently strong,
A complex network, where all belong.
