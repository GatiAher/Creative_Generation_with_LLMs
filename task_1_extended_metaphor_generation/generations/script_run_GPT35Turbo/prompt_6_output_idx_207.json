      "metaphor": "both Concurrency in distributed computing and Blockchain in money have Parallelism as a common characteristic",
      "concurrency": "Parallelism in distributed computing enables different tasks to run simultaneously, maximizing resource utilization and reducing wait times by allowing multiple tasks to progress concurrently.",
      "blockchain": "Similarly, in Blockchain technology, parallelism is observed with multiple transactions being processed simultaneously across the network, increasing transaction throughput and reducing confirmation times, thus optimizing resource utilization."

      "metaphor": "both Concurrency in distributed computing and Blockchain in money have Modularity as a common characteristic",
      "concurrency": "Modularity in distributed computing structures tasks like a network of interconnected bridges where each task can run independently, promoting scalability and ease of maintenance.",
      "blockchain": "Similarly, Blockchain's decentralized nature embodies modularity by enabling each transaction to function independently, connected through a chain of blocks\u2014allowing for seamless scalability and improved fault tolerance."

      "metaphor": "both Concurrency in distributed computing and Blockchain in money have Resource Sharing as a common characteristic",
      "concurrency": "Resource Sharing in distributed computing ensures that resources can be efficiently shared among tasks, enhancing overall system performance and fairness in resource allocation.",
      "blockchain": "In Blockchain technology, resource sharing is evident as all nodes in the network share and validate transactions collectively, utilizing the available resources efficiently to secure and maintain the integrity of the network."

      "metaphor": "both Concurrency in distributed computing and Blockchain in money have Non-Blocking Design as a common characteristic",
      "concurrency": "Non-Blocking Design in distributed computing prevents one task from blocking the progress of others, thereby ensuring smooth operation and improved responsiveness in the system.",
      "blockchain": "Blockchain's Non-Blocking Design eliminates central points of failure and censorship by decentralizing control and decision-making, enabling transactions to process freely without dependencies, ensuring the system's continued operation and integrity."
