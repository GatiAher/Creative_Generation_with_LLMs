Like lava in a volcano, cryptocurrency flows,
Heat and pressure redistributed, a design that shows.
Through channels and cracks, they move with ease,
Maintaining equilibrium, unraveling mysteries.

Less dense than solid rocks, they rise and ascend,
Lava and cryptocurrency, both on the mend.
Fluid flow as a principle, finding paths of least resistance,
Creating new landscapes, in every instance.

In the depths of the Earth or the digital domain,
Lava and cryptocurrency, not so mundane.
Their design principles mirror each other's grace,
Flowing and rising, in their own unique space.
