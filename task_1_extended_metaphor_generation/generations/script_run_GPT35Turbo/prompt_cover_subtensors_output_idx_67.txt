Plate tectonics can be likened to the concept of money, with the Earth's crust being analogous to a wallet of currency. Just as money is constantly in motion, flowing between hands and institutions, plate boundaries act as the transaction points where plates interact and exchange energy. Subduction zones are like banks, where plates are pushed beneath one another, much like money being deposited and withdrawn.

Mid-ocean ridges can be compared to stock exchanges, bustling hubs of activity where new crust is formed and old crust is recycled. Just as financial markets experience fluctuations and shifts, plate movements cause earthquakes and volcanic eruptions that shape the landscape. Continental drift is reminiscent of investments that yield returns over time, as continents slowly migrate across the globe, influencing climates and ecosystems.

Overall, plate tectonics and money both involve movement, exchange, and transformation, highlighting the interconnected and dynamic nature of our planet and our economies.
