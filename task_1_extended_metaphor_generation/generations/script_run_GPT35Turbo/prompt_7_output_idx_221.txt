In the atmosphere's composition, as in pitcher rotations,
A balance is key for life's vital equations.
Gases or pitchers, in ratios specified,
Supporting processes and strategies dignified.

With harmony in gases or in team's cohesive play,
Success is ensured in each balanced array.
Design principles in both, meticulously aligned,
To regulate and optimize, stability defined.
