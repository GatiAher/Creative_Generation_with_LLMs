Like DNA's chromosomes, the baseball field's dimensions,
Both hold a blueprint for optimal organization and precision.
Efficiently storing and structuring their elements with care,
Creating a foundation that dictates how they function and fare.

Just as chromosomes rely on structural proteins in their design,
Baseball fields incorporate components to define their line.
Histones and foul poles, each playing a crucial role,
In organizing and guiding the genetic code and game's goal.
