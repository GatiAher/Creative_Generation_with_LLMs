Like contour lines on maps and infographics in cash,
They simplify and connect, reducing the mass.
Visualizing shape and elevation with ease,
Both bring clarity, designed to please.

Regular intervals and closed curves they share,
Simplifying complex data with care.
Dimensionality reduced to 2D grid,
Aiding understanding, as their purpose is bid.
