Like a well-designed building layout,
Data structures and baseball stats databases both play,
Efficient storage and access they ensure,
Creating systems that are streamlined and secure.

With arrays, trees, and graphs, data structures organize,
While in baseball databases, indexing and querying harmonize,
Systematic organization in a structured design,
Optimizing retrieval and manipulation, they intertwine.

Just like a building's functionality is enhanced,
These systems improve performance, making data easily danced,
From quick retrieval of numbers in a program,
To detailed player stats for teams and their exam.

So, whether in code or on the baseball field,
Efficient storage and access they both yield,
Like a well-planned building layout to a structure's delight,
Data structures and databases shine in optimization's light.
