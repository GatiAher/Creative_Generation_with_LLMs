Grid Computing can be compared to tessellation in geometry, where individual computing resources act as tiles that come together to form a larger, unified grid. This unified grid allows for efficient resource sharing and collaboration among different domains, enabling complex computations requiring significant computational power to be completed effectively. In {{Grid Computing}}, the computing resources are interconnected, forming a structured network similar to an interconnected grid of nodes in a mathematical graph. This structure facilitates the distribution of computational tasks across the grid, allowing for parallel processing and cooperative resource utilization to handle large-scale problems and data-intensive tasks efficiently.
