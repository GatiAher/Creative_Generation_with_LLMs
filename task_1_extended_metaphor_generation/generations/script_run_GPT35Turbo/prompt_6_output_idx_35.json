      "security": "Similarly, in the realm of money, Security measures are put in place as a form of redundancy to provide additional support and ensure the stability and integrity of financial systems. This may include multi-layered authentication processes and redundant backup systems to safeguard against external threats."

      "dark_matter": "Dark Matter exhibits resilience by maintaining the structure of the universe despite the changing external forces, such as the laws of geometry and physics that govern its expansion.",
      "security": "Likewise, Security measures in financial systems provide resilience by enabling them to withstand external threats such as cyber attacks or market fluctuations. This resilience ensures the stability and integrity of the financial ecosystem even in the face of adversities."
