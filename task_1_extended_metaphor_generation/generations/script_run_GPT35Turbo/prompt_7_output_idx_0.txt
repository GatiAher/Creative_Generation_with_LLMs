Planets and Kpop, in equilibrium they stand,
Gravitational forces and dancers in hand.
Elliptical paths, guiding their way,
In precise motions, they both sway.

Mathematical principles, laws of the trade,
Predicting movements, the paths they've made.
Orbital configurations, a stable stance,
In celestial bodies and dancers' dance.

Just as the planets align in the sky,
Kpop choreography catches the eye.
Balanced and harmonious, they both prove,
In their gravitational equilibrium groove.
