In molecules and money, parallels align,
Lewis Structures and Blockchain both intertwine.
Visualization and modeling, they both emphasize,
For understanding interactions and where value lies.

Geometric representation, lines and chains,
Show atom connections and financial gains.
2D structural analysis, systematic and clear,
In both realms, these tools steer.

Molecules and money, a common ground found,
Lewis Structures and Blockchain, their principles resound.
From blueprints to blocks, a familiar quest,
To visualize, analyze, and optimize what's best.
