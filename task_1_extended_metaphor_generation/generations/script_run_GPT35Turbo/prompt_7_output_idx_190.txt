Like a precise blueprint guiding construction,
SOAP API and J.A.R.V.I.S. serve their function.
Defining structure and providing critical aid,
With standardized formats, their purpose is laid.

Utilizing WSDL and XML for their task,
Ensuring consistency and seamless communication, a hard ask.
From API functionalities to Tony's commands,
Both serve as pillars in their respective lands.
