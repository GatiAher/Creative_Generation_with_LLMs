Hormones and pitcher's mound, 
Modular and precise they're found.
Communication and strategy they share, 
In body and baseball, design principles rare. 

Topology optimized, geometrically structured, 
For effective signaling ensured. 
Pitching with precision, aimed to deceive, 
Both systems designed to achieve.
