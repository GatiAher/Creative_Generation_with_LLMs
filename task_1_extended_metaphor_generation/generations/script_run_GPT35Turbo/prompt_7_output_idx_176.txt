In the world of code and K-pop's groove,
Programming and choreography both prove,
With syntax, rules, symbols in hand,
They communicate, create, and command.

From languages structured to Dances planned,
Their conventions and commands stand,
Guiding programmers and performers alike,
To bring to life a cohesive strike.
