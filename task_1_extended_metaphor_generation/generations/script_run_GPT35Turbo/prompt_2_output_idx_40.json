  "purpose": "Catalysis enhances the efficiency of chemical reactions by enlisting a specialized agent, which functions akin to a precision tool, to speed up the transformation process.",
  "mechanism": "Catalysis operates through a structured mechanism where the catalyst interacts with the reactants in a strategic geometric configuration, effectively lowering the activation energy required for the chemical reaction to proceed. This design facilitates a smoother path for the reaction to follow, resulting in optimized kinetics."
