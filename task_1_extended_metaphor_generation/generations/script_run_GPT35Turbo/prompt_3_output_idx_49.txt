"""{{RPC API}} serves as a tool for delegating specific tasks or calculations in a distributed system network, similar to how different parts of a complex [geometric] design rely on specialized measurements and calculations. The {{RPC API}} operates by enabling one program to request the execution of a specific procedure on another program within the network, facilitating communication and collaboration akin to interconnected [geometric] components working together to form a cohesive design."""
