Like a spinning top, Iron Man flies,
Angular momentum keeps him wise.
Just as Moment of Inertia holds tight,
Repulsors push back against the fight.

Angular Velocity, a crucial tool,
To make Iron Man fly, he's no one's fool.
With precision and speed, he alters course,
Just like a rotating object, they both endorse.

In momentum and Iron Man's suit,
Mechanisms work, both resolute.
Stability and control, they provide,
Inertia and Repulsors, side by side.
