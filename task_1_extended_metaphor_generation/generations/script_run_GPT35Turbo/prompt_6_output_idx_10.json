      "metaphor": "Just as celestial objects gracefully dance through different orbits in the solar system, Repulsor technology in Iron Man orchestrates a symphony of movements using orbital mechanics.",
      "asteroids": "Orbital mechanics are utilized in the solar system to organize celestial objects and influence their positions through various orbits.",
      "repulsor_technology": "In Iron Man, Repulsor technology mirrors this concept by strategically maneuvering Tony Stark through different orbits and trajectories, allowing him to navigate and engage with precision and finesse."
