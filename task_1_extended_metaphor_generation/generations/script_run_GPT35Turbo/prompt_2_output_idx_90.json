  "purpose": "D-branes serve as boundaries or surfaces that interact with strings in order to study the behavior and properties of string theory in relation to higher dimensions and complex mathematical spaces.",
  "mechanism": "D-branes are like flexible membranes that can vibrate and interact with strings in multiple dimensions, providing a geometric framework for analyzing the dynamics of strings and the underlying structure of spacetime in superstring theory."
