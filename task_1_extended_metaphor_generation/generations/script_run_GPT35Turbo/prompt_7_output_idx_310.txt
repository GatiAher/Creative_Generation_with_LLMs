Just like the Arc Reactor in Iron Man,
Radiogenic Isotope Analysis has a plan.
With mathematical modeling they both shine,
Precision engineering in their design.

One calculates time of decay,
The other powers Iron Man's display.
Both showcase the connection clear,
Between math and technology's frontier.
