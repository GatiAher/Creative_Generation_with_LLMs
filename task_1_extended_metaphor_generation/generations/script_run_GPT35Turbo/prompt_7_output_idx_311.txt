Radiogenic Isotope Analysis and Blockchain,
Both rely on precision, like a tailor's fine stitch.
Mathematical modeling, the guiding force,
Ensures accuracy in tracing origins and financial course.

Just as isotopes reveal Earth's ancient tale,
Blockchain secures money's path without fail.
Through meticulous design, they both excel,
Precision engineering, their stories to tell.
