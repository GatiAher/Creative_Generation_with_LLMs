The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation in big bang theory is like the Arc Reactor in Iron Man - both serve as foundational blueprints that provide critical insight into the early stages and overall design. Just as Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation offers a snapshot of the universe's origins, the Arc Reactor fuels Tony Stark's suit with essential energy for its technology and design.

Inflation Theory in big bang theory is akin to the Arc Reactor in Iron Man for their emphasis on exponential expansion. While Inflation Theory drives rapid expansion and smoothing of the universe's geometry, the Arc Reactor generates energy exponentially to power the suit with efficiency and balance.

The Singularity in Big Bang Theory shares qualities with the Arc Reactor in Iron Man - both exhibit characteristics of compression, foundation establishment, and structuring. The Singularity compresses matter to infinite density to initiate the universe, much like the Arc Reactor compresses energy to power the suit efficiently and effectively.

Dark Matter in big bang theory is like the Nano Repulsor Shield in Iron Man for their redundancy mechanisms that provide additional support and ensure stability. Dark Matter acts as a gravitational force to maintain the universe's structure, while the Nano Repulsor Shield protects Tony Stark by creating a shield around him, ensuring his resilience against external threats.
