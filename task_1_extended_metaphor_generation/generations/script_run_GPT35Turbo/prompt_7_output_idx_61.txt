In ecosystems and on the baseball field,
Geometric optimization is revealed.
Efficient resource use, interconnected patterns too,
Both habitats and diamond fields, their designs renew.

Organizing, utilizing, interconnecting with care,
In ecosystems and baseball, the common threads we share.
Complex network designs, maximizing space,
For survival and gameplay, in each unique place.
