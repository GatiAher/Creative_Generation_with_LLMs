      "metaphor": "Both Greenhouse Effect in atmosphere and Arc Reactor in Iron Man act as a shield against external temperature fluctuations and play a crucial role in sustaining a stable environment within their respective systems.",
      "greenhouse_effect": "The Greenhouse Effect involves the trapping of heat by certain gases in the Earth's atmosphere, serving as a protective blanket to prevent the loss of heat into space. This mechanism helps maintain the planet's temperature levels and supports life by creating a habitable environment.",
      "arc_reactor": "Similarly, the Arc Reactor in Iron Man functions as a source of power and stabilizes Tony Stark's vital functions, much like how the Greenhouse Effect stabilizes the Earth's temperature. By regulating energy output and providing a consistent flow of power, the Arc Reactor ensures Iron Man's survival and functionality in various situations."
