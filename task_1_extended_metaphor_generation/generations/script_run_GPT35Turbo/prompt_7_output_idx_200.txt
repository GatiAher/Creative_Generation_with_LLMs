Distributed systems and Kpop groups in sync,
Redundancy and division, their methods link.
Like nodes in a graph, tasks are dispersed,
Message passing ensures coordination is rehearsed.

Just as systems run smoothly when tasks align,
Kpop groups shine bright when in sync they chime.
Decentralization and collaboration in play,
Seamless interaction, their success will stay.
