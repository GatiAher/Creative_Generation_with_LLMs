  "purpose": "Software Development can be thought of as the process of architecting and constructing a virtual blueprint that dictates how a sequence of interconnected components must behave to perform specific functions. This is akin to the creation of a complex geometric design that outlines how various shapes and patterns interact to form a unified structure with specific functionalities.",
  "mechanism": "Software Development involves breaking down the overall design into smaller, manageable pieces (modules) that can be systematically crafted, tested, and refined. This process mirrors the mathematical concept of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, solvable components to solve a larger equation. By meticulously arranging and interconnecting these modules within a well-defined framework (architecture), Software Development ensures that the final product functions as intended, much like how an engineered system is meticulously designed to support the desired functionalities."
