      "metaphor": "both Lava in volcano and Choreography in Kpop have heat redistribution as a design principle",
      "lava": "Lava redistributes heat and pressure from within the volcano to the surface through a fluid medium, ensuring the release of built-up energy and maintaining equilibrium.",
      "choreography": "Similarly, choreography redistributes the energy and creativity of the performers, ensuring a dynamic performance that captivates the audience and expresses the music with fluid movements."

      "metaphor": "both Lava in volcano and Choreography in Kpop have density contrast as a design principle",
      "lava": "Structured as a molten rock that is less dense than the surrounding solid rocks, Lava is able to rise and flow, finding paths through the earth's crust with its lighter density.",
      "choreography": "In Choreography, the contrast in movements and formations creates visual interest and depth, much like how the density contrast in Lava allows it to flow and shape the landscape."

    {
      "metaphor": "both Lava in volcano and Choreography in Kpop have fluid flow as a design principle",
      "lava": "Lava flows through fractures and weak points in the volcano, following the principle of fluid dynamics to find its way to the surface and release its energy.",
      "choreography": "Choreography also flows through the dancers, utilizing the fluidity of movements to transition seamlessly between steps and formations, showcasing the beauty of motion and synchronization."
