Like a double helix in DNA,
Choreography in Kpop does sway.
Structural redundancy, efficient space,
Modularity in both, they embrace.

Twisting spirals hold genetic code,
Intricate moves on stage unfold.
Compact formations, storing data,
Tight arrangements, narratives catered.

Modular sections, easy to rearrange,
Fluid movements, ready for change.
Just like DNA, Kpop choreo's design,
Efficient, versatile, intertwine.
