Like continents shifting in a seamless dance,
Earth's lithosphere plates twirl and prance.
Optimizing their positions with grace,
In a well-choreographed Kpop embrace.

Balanced formations, geometric and neat,
In both realms, equilibrium they meet.
From plate tectonics to music's flow,
Harmony and stability in each they show.
