Like a dance of nodes in the digital realm,
Distributed Systems and Blockchain at the helm.
Redundancy and division of tasks they share,
Ensuring stability and reliability with great care.

Decentralized, like vertices on a graph,
Each node with specific duties to staff.
Message passing for communication so clear,
Ensuring seamless interaction far and near.
