      "metaphor": "both Plate Boundaries in plate tectonics and Currency Exchange in money have Interfaces as a key design principle facilitating the exchange and redistribution of forces, energy, and material within a system by providing points of contact for interaction.",
      "plate_boundaries": "Plate Boundaries serve as the points where tectonic plates meet, allowing for the transfer of energy and material through processes like subduction, spreading, or sliding. These interactions shape the Earth's surface and contribute to geological events such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions.",
      "currency_exchange": "Similarly, Currency Exchange acts as the interface between different currencies, enabling the conversion and transfer of value. Just as Plate Boundaries facilitate the movement of forces and material in the Earth's crust, Currency Exchange facilitates the movement of capital and assets across different economies, supporting global trade and financial transactions."

      "metaphor": "both Plate Boundaries in plate tectonics and Currency Exchange in money have Structures as a key design principle organizing the components or elements of a system into distinct entities that serve specific functions or purposes.",
      "plate_boundaries": "Plate Boundaries help structure the Earth's lithosphere into separate tectonic plates, each with unique characteristics and behaviors. The boundaries delineate the areas where different plates interact, influencing geological processes and landforms.",
      "currency_exchange": "Currency Exchange structures the global financial system by classifying currencies according to exchange rates, market demand, and regulatory frameworks. This organization creates distinct currency markets and mechanisms for trading, ensuring efficient exchange operations and price discovery."

      "metaphor": "both Plate Boundaries in plate tectonics and Currency Exchange in money have Differentiation as a key design principle creating variations or differences between components within a system to accommodate diverse activities or functionalities.",
      "plate_boundaries": "Plate Boundaries exhibit differentiation by generating diverse geologic features such as mountains, valleys, and ocean basins. The varying plate boundaries, from convergent to divergent, foster different geological activities and landscapes.",
      "currency_exchange": "Currency Exchange showcases differentiation through the existence of various currency pairs and exchange mechanisms tailored to different market needs. The diversity in currencies, exchange rates, and market participants enables flexibility and customization in conducting financial transactions worldwide."
