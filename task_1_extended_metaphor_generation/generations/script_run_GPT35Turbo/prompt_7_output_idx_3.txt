Cryptocurrencies soar like planets in space,
Their orbits and paths in perfect grace.
Just like gravity keeps planets in line,
Transactions and interactions form a fine design.

Mathematical laws govern their way,
Predictable and steady, day by day.
Stability achieved through balance and flow,
In the digital realm, their value grow.

Orbital configurations, stable and strong,
Celestial bodies dance in harmony's song.
Cryptocurrency network, resilient and firm,
Building structures that withstand any storm.
