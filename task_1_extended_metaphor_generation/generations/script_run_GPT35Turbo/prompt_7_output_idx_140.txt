In the dance of molecules with precision,
Intermolecular Forces determine their decision.
Like Kpop choreography on stage,
Both aim for stability, order, and engage.

From dipole-dipole to hydrogen bonds,
Molecular compounds form their bonds.
Just like dancers moving in sync,
Organizing movements, no time to think.

Efficient packing and arrangements they seek,
In both systems, harmony they speak.
Intermolecular Forces and choreography shine,
Bringing stability and organization aligned.
