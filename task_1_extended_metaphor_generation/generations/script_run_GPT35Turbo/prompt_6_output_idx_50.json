      "metaphor": "both Black Holes in theory of the naked singularity and Arc Reactor in Iron Man have Concentration of Mass and Density as a vital design element.",
      "black_holes": "In the theory of naked singularities, this concentration of mass and density creates an intense gravitational pull that warps spacetime, creating a region of extreme gravity that nothing can escape from.",
      "arc_reactor": "Similar to the black hole's mechanism, the Arc Reactor in Iron Man also utilizes a concentration of mass and density to generate immense energy. This design allows Tony Stark to power his Iron Man suit and other technology with a high level of efficiency."

      "metaphor": "both Black Holes in theory of the naked singularity and Arc Reactor in Iron Man have an Event Horizon as a defining feature.",
      "black_holes": "The event horizon of a black hole marks the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape. It traps matter and energy within, leading to the extreme gravitational effects associated with black holes.",
      "arc_reactor": "Similarly, the Arc Reactor in Iron Man also features a boundary that contains and controls the immense energy generated. This containment allows the energy to be harnessed effectively without causing harm to the surroundings, akin to the event horizon's role in trapping matter and energy within a black hole."
