Like distributed systems and J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man,
Redundancy ensures stability with a backup plan.
Tasks divided among entities, working in parallel,
Efficiently processing commands, avoiding any quarrel.

Decentralized nodes in a graph-like array,
Working independently yet collaborating each day.
Message passing for communication, ensuring coordination,
Seamless interaction and synchronization, a shared foundation.
