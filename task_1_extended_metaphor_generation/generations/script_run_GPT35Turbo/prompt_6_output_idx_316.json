      "metaphor": "Both Kinetic Energy in energy and 'Performance energy level' in Kpop have an energy principle that helps in calculating the work required for moving objects by considering factors like velocity and mass. It enables understanding the energy associated with the motion of objects without direct measurement.",
      "kinetic_energy": "Kinetic energy determines the energy associated with the motion of objects by taking into account the squared value of velocity. Objects with higher velocities or greater mass possess more kinetic energy, reflecting their potential impact.",
      "performance_energy_level": "Similarly, 'Performance energy level' in Kpop reflects the energy required for dynamic performances by considering factors like the intensity of dance moves and the charisma of the performers. It allows us to gauge the energy and impact of a Kpop performance without needing to measure it directly."
