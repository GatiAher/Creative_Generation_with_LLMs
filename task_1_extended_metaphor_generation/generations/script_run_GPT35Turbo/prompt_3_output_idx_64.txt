"""The {{Arctic Oscillation}} functions as a regulating system that helps maintain a balanced atmospheric circulation in higher {{latitudes}}, affecting weather patterns and temperatures in mid-latitudes. The {{Arctic Oscillation}} is structured as a fluctuation between negative and positive phases, where a stronger vortex in the negative phase confines cold air to the polar regions, while a weaker vortex in the positive phase allows the cold air to meander southward, impacting weather patterns in lower latitudes."""
