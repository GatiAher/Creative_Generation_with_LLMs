"""The {{Inflation Theory}} serves the purpose of resolving various issues encountered in the initial stages of the {{Big Bang theory}} by explaining the rapid and expansive growth of the early universe in a way that aligns with [geometric] and [mathematical] principles. The {{Inflation Theory}} proposes an initial phase of exponential expansion driven by a {{scalar field}} that resulted in the smoothing out of the universe's geometry, ensuring a more uniform and flat spacetime. This mechanism, grounded in [engineering] and [design] principles, accounts for the observed large-scale homogeneity and isotropy of the universe."""
