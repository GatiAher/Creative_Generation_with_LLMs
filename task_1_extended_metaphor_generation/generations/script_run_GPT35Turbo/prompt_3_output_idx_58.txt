"The {{Greenhouse Effect}} serves the purpose of regulating the temperature of the Earth's surface by retaining heat within the atmosphere, similar to how insulation works in a building. This helps in maintaining a habitable environment for various life forms on Earth. The Greenhouse Effect functions through a series of interactions involving incoming solar radiation, absorption of heat by the Earth's surface, and the trapping of some of this heat by certain gases in the atmosphere, such as {{carbon dioxide}} and {{methane}}. These gases act like a blanket, preventing a portion of the heat from escaping into space and thus keeping the Earth warmer than it would be otherwise."
