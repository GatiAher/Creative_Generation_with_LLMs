This helps in maintaining a habitable environment for various life forms on Earth.","The Greenhouse Effect functions through a series of interactions involving incoming solar radiation, absorption of heat by the Earth's surface, and the trapping of some of this heat by certain gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide and methane. These gases act like a blanket, preventing a portion of the heat from escaping into space and thus keeping the Earth warmer than it would be otherwise.","The Greenhouse Effect serves the purpose of regulating the temperature of the Earth's surface by retaining heat within the atmosphere, similar to how insulation works in a building.
