  "purpose": "Kinetic Energy is essential for calculating the work required for moving objects in fields like engineering and design. It enables engineers to understand the energy associated with the motion of objects without directly measuring their speed or mass.",
  "mechanism": "Kinetic Energy is determined by the velocity and mass of an object through a calculation that considers the squared value of the velocity. This structure ensures that objects with higher velocities or greater mass possess more Kinetic Energy, reflecting their potential impact and the force needed to stop their motion."
