  "purpose": "Chemical Energy serves as a form of stored potential energy within the atomic bonds of chemical compounds. It provides a means for storing and releasing energy during chemical reactions, enabling the transformation of energy for various uses.",
  "mechanism": "Chemical Energy is structured as the energy stored within the specific arrangements of atoms and molecules in a compound. These bonds hold potential energy that can be released through chemical reactions, leading to the formation of new compounds and the transfer of energy from one form to another."
