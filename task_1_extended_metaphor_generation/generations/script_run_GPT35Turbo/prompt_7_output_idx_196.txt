In RPC and Kpop, we see,
Principles like Decomposition, Abstraction, and Modularity.
Just like geometric parts in API's design,
Kpop members bring talents aligned.

Breaking down, abstracting away,
Specialized roles come into play.
Modularity in network components,
Each member's part, vital and consistent.

Collaboration in song and dance,
RPC principles in a coding stance.
Different elements, working as one,
Creating harmony when all is done.
