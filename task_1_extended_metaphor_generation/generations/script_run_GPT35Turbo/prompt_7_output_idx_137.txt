Like architects of a grand design,
Molecular Geometry and Fielding alignment align.
In spatial optimization they both excel,
Arranging elements in a harmonious spell.

With mathematical symmetry as their guide,
Atoms and fielders strategically abide.
Ensuring balance and perfect symmetry,
For stability and defensive supremacy.

Spatial positioning their principle aim,
To minimize clashes and defensive shame.
In molecules and baseball fields alike,
Precision and strategy in their strike.
