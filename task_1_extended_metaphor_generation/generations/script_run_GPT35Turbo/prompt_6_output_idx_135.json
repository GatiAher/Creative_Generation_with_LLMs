      "metaphor": "both Lewis Structures in molecular compounds and Blockchain in money have a focus on Visualization and Modeling",
      "lewis_structures": "In Lewis Structures, visual blueprints are used to predict and understand the spatial arrangement and bonding patterns of molecules. This enables precise modeling of interactions and behaviors within the molecular compounds.",
      "blockchain": "Similarly, Blockchain technology in money relies on a visual representation of transactions and blocks to predict and understand the flow of funds and verify ownership. It uses this modeling to ensure the precise recording and tracking of transactions and behaviors within the financial system."

      "metaphor": "both Lewis Structures in molecular compounds and Blockchain in money have a focus on Geometric Representation",
      "lewis_structures": "Lewis Structures indicate atom connections and shared electron pairs using lines and dots, allowing for the visualization of geometric relationships and electron distributions within the molecules.",
      "blockchain": "Likewise, Blockchain in money utilizes a geometric representation of blocks and chains to show the connections and relationships between transactions and participants. This visual approach helps in understanding the distribution and movement of funds within the financial network."

      "metaphor": "both Lewis Structures in molecular compounds and Blockchain in money have a focus on 2D Structural Analysis",
      "lewis_structures": "In Lewis Structures, the electronic framework of molecules is represented in a 2D format, enabling systematic analysis and manipulation of molecular structures for scientific purposes.",
      "blockchain": "Similarly, Blockchain technology in money employs a 2D structural analysis of the financial transactions and blocks, allowing for the systematic examination and control of the flow of funds and data within the financial system."
