Plate Movements and choreography, 
A dance of force and energy, 
Optimizing pathways with precision, 
Creating seamless transitions with vision.

Dynamic reconfiguration, a common thread, 
Changing boundaries on which movements are led, 
From earthquakes to captivating shows, 
Balancing load for a harmonious flow.
