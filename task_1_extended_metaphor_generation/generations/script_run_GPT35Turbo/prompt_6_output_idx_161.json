      "catalysis": "Catalysis involves enlisting a specialized agent (catalyst) to speed up a transformation process by lowering activation energy. This specialized agent acts as a facilitator to enhance the overall reaction.",
      "pitch_framing": "Similarly, in Pitch Framing, the catcher positions themselves strategically to optimize the efficiency of receiving pitches. By framing the pitch effectively through precise movements and positioning, the catcher aims to influence the umpire's perception of the pitch, potentially gaining an advantage for the team."

      "catalysis": "In Catalysis, structuring the catalyst and reactants in a strategic geometric configuration is key to facilitating a smoother path for the reaction. The precise arrangement enables the catalyst to interact effectively with the reactants, enhancing the reaction rate.",
      "pitch_framing": "In Pitch Framing, the catcher's positioning and movements behind the plate form a geometric configuration aimed at influencing the umpire's perception of the pitch. By framing the pitch within this strategic setup, the catcher can potentially turn borderline pitches into strikes, showcasing the importance of geometry in the process."

      "catalysis": "Catalysis involves designing for optimized efficiency in the transformation process. By selecting the right catalyst and optimizing the conditions, the goal is to achieve the desired reaction outcome with maximum efficiency.",
      "pitch_framing": "Pitch Framing also centers on optimization, with catchers aiming to maximize the efficiency of pitch reception. Through precise movements, timing, and framing techniques, catchers seek to optimize the outcome of each pitch by influencing the umpire's call in favor of the team."
