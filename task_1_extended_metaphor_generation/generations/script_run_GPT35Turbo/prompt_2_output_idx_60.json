  "purpose": "The Scale serves to accurately represent the physical distance between points on a map in a proportionate manner, enabling precise measurements and comparisons without the need for real-world exploration.",
  "mechanism": "The Scale is established as a ratio, denoting the relationship between the measurements on the map and the corresponding actual measurements on the ground. This ratio is maintained consistently across the entire map, facilitating uniform scaling of distances and dimensions to ensure accuracy and reliability in interpreting spatial information."
