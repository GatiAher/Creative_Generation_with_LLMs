Software code and currency, alike in design,
With modularity and hierarchy, they align.
Modules in programs, units in cash,
Divided and connected, in a structured hash.

Break it down, piece by piece,
In software and money, design will not cease.
From hierarchy's order to modularity's grace,
Both systems function with finesse and pace.
