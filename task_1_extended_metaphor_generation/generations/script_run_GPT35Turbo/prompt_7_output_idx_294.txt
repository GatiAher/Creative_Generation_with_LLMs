Just as Mid-Ocean Ridges expand Earth's crust,
Creating fresh land with an unwavering thrust,
The Arc Reactor in Iron Man, without fail,
Generates energy for his heroic tale.

Both with Redundancy, they persistently create,
Ensuring continuity and avoiding a stalemate,
With Resilience, they stand strong and true,
In plate tectonics and technology's debut.
