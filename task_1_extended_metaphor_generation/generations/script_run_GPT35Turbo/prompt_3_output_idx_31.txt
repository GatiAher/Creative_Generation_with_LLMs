"""The purpose of the {{Endothermic Reaction}} is to utilize external thermal energy in a way that maintains or increases the stability of the system involved. The {{Endothermic Reaction}} is structured to consume heat energy from the surroundings to facilitate changes in the internal configuration of the system. This absorption of energy supports the desired outcomes, leading to a state of higher internal energy within the system even in the absence of external heat sources."""
