  "purpose": "Magma acts as a highly viscous fluid reservoir that fuels the dynamic processes of the Earth's crust.",
  "mechanism": "Magma is formed in the Earth's mantle through the process of partial melting, where solid rocks are transformed into molten rock due to high temperatures and pressures. The buoyant nature of Magma, being less dense than the surrounding solid rock, causes it to rise towards the surface. The structural design of Magma, with its ability to flow and carry heat and material from the mantle to the crust, facilitates volcanic activity and the formation of new land features."
