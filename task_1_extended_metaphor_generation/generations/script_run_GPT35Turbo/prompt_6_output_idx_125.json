      "metaphor": "Both Endothermic Reaction in chemical reaction and Pitching in baseball have the characteristic of utilizing external thermal energy to maintain or increase system stability.",
      "endothermic_reaction": "In Endothermic Reactions, the system absorbs heat energy from the surroundings to promote the reaction and maintain its stability. This process helps the reaction proceed and reach completion by providing the necessary energy input from the surroundings.",
      "pitching": "Similarly, in Pitching, the pitcher utilizes the energy generated from their body to throw the baseball with precision and force. By harnessing external energy in the form of body mechanics and kinetic energy, the pitcher maintains control over the game and influences the outcome through precise movements and energy transfer."

      "metaphor": "Both Endothermic Reaction in chemical reaction and Pitching in baseball involve consuming heat energy from the surroundings to facilitate changes in internal system configuration.",
      "endothermic_reaction": "Endothermic Reactions absorb heat from the surroundings to enable the reactants to undergo a chemical transformation. This consumption of heat energy allows the reactants to overcome activation energy barriers and proceed with the desired reaction.",
      "pitching": "Likewise, in Pitching, the pitcher consumes internal energy and transfers it to the baseball to create the desired trajectory and speed. This process involves harnessing the surrounding heat energy to fuel the pitcher's movements and ultimately change the game's dynamic by controlling the pitch delivery."
