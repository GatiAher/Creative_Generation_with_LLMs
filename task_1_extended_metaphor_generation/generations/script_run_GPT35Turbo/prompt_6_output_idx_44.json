      "event_horizon": "The Event Horizon serves as a geometric boundary in the theory of naked singularities, marking the limit of a black hole's influence and preventing anything from escaping.",
      "concept_album": "Similarly, a Concept Album in Kpop establishes a thematic boundary that defines the overarching concept or story of the album, encapsulating all songs and visual elements within its narrative."

      "metaphor": "both Event Horizon in theory of the naked singularity and Concept Album in Kpop possess a Barrier Function that captures all matter and energy within its influence",
      "event_horizon": "The Event Horizon acts as a barrier capturing all matter and energy within the black hole's gravitational pull, preventing anything from exiting beyond a certain point.",
      "concept_album": "Likewise, a Concept Album in Kpop functions as a creative barrier, capturing the essence of the album's concept and ensuring that all songs and accompanying content align with the central theme."

      "event_horizon": "The Event Horizon's structure is mathematically defined based on the mass of the black hole, determining the distance at which the gravitational pull becomes so strong that even light cannot escape.",
      "concept_album": "Similarly, a Concept Album in Kpop is structured around a mathematically defined radius of themes and motifs derived from the concept, specifying the boundaries within which the album's artistic direction operates."

      "event_horizon": "At a certain point, the spacetime curvature near the Event Horizon becomes so severe due to the black hole's mass that the escape velocity surpasses the speed of light, creating a one-way boundary.",
      "concept_album": "Likewise, a Concept Album in Kpop embodies a severe conceptual curvature where the thematic depth and consistency of the album's concept dictate a one-way journey for the listener, guiding them through a cohesive and immersive musical experience."
