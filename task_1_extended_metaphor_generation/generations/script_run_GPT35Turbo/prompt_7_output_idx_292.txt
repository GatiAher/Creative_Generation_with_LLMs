Like Mid-Ocean Ridges and Kpop collaborations,
Both possess redundancy in their formations.
Creating new crust and music in succession,
Ensuring growth and diversity without regression.

Resilience they share, in balance and evolution,
Continuously generating to avoid stagnation.
Just as the Earth's crust and Kpop industry thrive,
Through collaborations and ridges they strive.
