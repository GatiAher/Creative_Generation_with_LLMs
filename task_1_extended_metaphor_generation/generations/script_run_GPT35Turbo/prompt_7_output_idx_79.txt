Like chromosomes in DNA, 
Blockchain acts in a similar way.
Both serve as a blueprint,
Organizing data in a secure script.

Efficient storage they both uphold,
Maximizing resources, bold.
With structural proteins they align,
Achieving functions divine.

In DNA and Blockchain we see,
Complex systems working seamlessly.
A blueprint for life and money,
Organized with precision, how funny.
