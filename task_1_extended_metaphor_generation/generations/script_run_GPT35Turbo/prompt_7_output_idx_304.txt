Like dancers on a stage, 
Stable Isotope Analysis and Choreography analysis engage.
With math at their core, they both stand tall,
Utilizing geometric principles to predict and enthrall.

Structured and predictive in their approach,
Analyzing patterns to unveil and encroach.
Isotopes and choreographies, they both dissect,
With mathematical modeling, their success is architect.

Two disciplines, seemingly worlds apart,
Yet connected by math, they embrace at heart.
Stable Isotope Analysis and Kpopâ€™s song choreo,
In their methodology and rigor, they both bestow.
