Like nodes in a network, we stand,
Concurrency and Kpop covers hand in hand.
Parallelism, Modularity, Resource Sharing unite,
In distributed computing and music, their light shines bright.

Tasks run simultaneously, singers harmonize,
Independent yet connected, each part vital, each voice wise.
Efficient sharing of resources, talents on display,
Non-blocking design, smooth operation, in both realms they sway.
