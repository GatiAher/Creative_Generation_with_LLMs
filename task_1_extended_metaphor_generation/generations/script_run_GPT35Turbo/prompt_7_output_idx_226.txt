Like layers in the sky and Iron Man's gear,
Modularity partitions, making functions clear.
Each part with a purpose, in regions distinct,
For control, analysis, efficiency linked.

Hierarchy rules, from top to the base,
In atmosphere layers and Iron Man's grace.
Structured by properties, understanding aids,
With boundaries defined, where parameters cascade.

Boundary delimitation, where changes abrupt,
In the sky and on Iron Man's suit, it's not corrupt.
Scientific analysis, simplified and neat,
Both cases showcase boundaries, a defining feat.
