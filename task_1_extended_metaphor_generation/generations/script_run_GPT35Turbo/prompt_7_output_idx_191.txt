Just like a blueprint for a building's design,
SOAP API and Cryptocurrency align.
With dimensions and rules clearly outlined,
Both systems function with a standardized mind.

SOAP API acts as the blueprint for web services,
Defining structures and connections with ease.
Cryptocurrency serves as the financial blueprint,
Managing transactions with cryptographic hints.

Standardized message format is the key,
For both SOAP API and Cryptocurrency, you see.
Ensuring data is clear and uniformly processed,
In interconnected systems and digital transactions obsessed.
