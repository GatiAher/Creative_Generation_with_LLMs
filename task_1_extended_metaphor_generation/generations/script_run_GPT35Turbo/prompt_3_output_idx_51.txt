"""{{Concurrency}} in {{distributed computing}} is like [designing] a city with multiple intersections allowing traffic to flow smoothly. It enables different tasks to run at the same time, maximizing the utilization of resources and reducing wait times. {{Concurrency}} is structured like a network of interconnected bridges in a city, where each bridge represents a task and the connections enable tasks to run independently. This structure ensures that resources can be shared efficiently and that one task does not block the progress of others."""
