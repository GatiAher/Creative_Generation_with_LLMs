"""The {{Rate-determining step}} serves as a bottleneck in the progression of a {{chemical reaction}} by controlling the speed at which the reaction proceeds. It ensures that the overall reaction rate is determined by the slowest individual step, thereby regulating the efficiency and outcome of the reaction. The {{Rate-determining step}} is [designed] to have the highest {{activation energy}} barrier among all the steps in a reaction pathway. This elevated barrier slows down the step significantly, making it the limiting factor in the overall reaction rate. The step with the maximum energy requirement constrains the rate at which reactants can progress through the reaction mechanism, influencing the speed and extent of the {{chemical transformation}}."""
