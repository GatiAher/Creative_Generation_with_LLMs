  "purpose": "Topographic Profiles provide a detailed visualization of the elevation changes along a specified path, offering insights into the terrain's vertical variations in a concise manner.",
  "mechanism": "The Topographic Profiles are structured as a cross-sectional representation of the terrain, with elevation values plotted against distance along a specific line. The structure aids in analyzing gradients, slopes, and vertical exaggeration, facilitating the understanding of the terrain's topographical features from a geometric and mathematical perspective."
