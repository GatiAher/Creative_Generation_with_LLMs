Like planets in their orbits, 
And players on the field, 
Both move in calculated paths,
With precision, skill, and yield.

Each position set in place,
To intercept and defend, 
Following laws and principles,
From start until the end.

Their equilibrium maintained,
By gravitational force and will,
Creating stability and balance,
Through strategy and skill.
