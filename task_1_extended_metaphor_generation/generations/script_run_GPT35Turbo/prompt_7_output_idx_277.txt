Like a volcano preparing to blow,
Or a pitcher winding up his throw,
Pressure builds up deep within,
Waiting for release to begin.

Both have mechanisms in place,
To prevent an explosive race,
Volcanic eruptions and pitching arms,
Designed to avoid any harm.

Structural design allows eruption,
For magma or ball to reach their destination,
Conduit formed to direct the flow,
Ensuring a safe release to go.
