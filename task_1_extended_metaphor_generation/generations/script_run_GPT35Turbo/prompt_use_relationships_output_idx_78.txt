Linear momentum is like Power Armor Technology in Iron Man, where both have a principle of motion analysis and mechanical design principles that enable understanding and manipulation of motion in a systematic way based on mechanics. 

Impulse is like Repulsor technology in Iron Man, as both focus on efficient energy transfer between objects through strategic application of force over time. They also emphasize integration and optimization to control and manipulate motion effectively.

Angular momentum is like Repulsors in Iron Man, as both have Moment of Inertia and Angular Velocity as key concepts and mechanisms. They resist changes in motion and provide stability by controlling rotational speed and direction, similar to how Iron Man uses Repulsors to stabilize and control his movements in complex scenarios.
