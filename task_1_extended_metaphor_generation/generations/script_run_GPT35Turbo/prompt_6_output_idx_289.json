      "subduction_zones": "Subduction zones in plate tectonics act as a mechanism for recycling old crust and creating new landforms through the process of one crust sliding beneath another",
      "groundskeeping": "Similarly, Groundskeeping in baseball involves maintaining and recycling the field by mowing, edging, aerating, and resurfacing to facilitate the renewal process for a safe and playable surface"

      "metaphor": "Subduction Zones in plate tectonics and Groundskeeping in baseball both involve convergent boundaries that allow one component to slide beneath another based on density and composition differences",
      "subduction_zones": "At convergent boundaries, subduction occurs where denser oceanic crust sinks beneath less dense continental crust, leading to the formation of trenches and volcanic arcs",
      "groundskeeping": "Similarly, in baseball, convergent boundaries could be seen as the areas where the infield meets the outfield, and the mechanisms of grooming and maintaining the field ensure a smooth transition and playing surface"

      "metaphor": "Subduction Zones in plate tectonics and Groundskeeping in baseball both exhibit the process of subduction which involves one crust sliding beneath another, leading to destruction and recycling of old crust to create new landforms",
      "subduction_zones": "Subduction involves the recycling of old oceanic crust into the mantle, where it melts and contributes to the formation of volcanic chains and new crust at divergent boundaries",
      "groundskeeping": "Groundskeeping also involves the recycling of materials like grass clippings and infield dirt to maintain the health and appearance of the field, ensuring that the playing surface remains in optimal condition for the game"
