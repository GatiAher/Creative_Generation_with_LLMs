  "purpose": "Contour Lines serve to visually represent the shape and elevation changes of the land surface in a concise and intuitive manner, aiding in understanding the terrain's topography without the need for detailed numerical data.",
  "mechanism": "Contour Lines are structured as closed curves on a map, connecting points that are at the same elevation above a reference datum. By spacing these lines at regular intervals, their density and proximity indicate the steepness and gradient of the terrain. The pattern of Contour Lines provides a 3D representation of the land's surface on a 2D map, enabling engineers and designers to interpret elevation changes accurately."
