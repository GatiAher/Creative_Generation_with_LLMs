Endocrine glands and Blockchain, 
A redundant design to maintain their reign. 
Like nodes in a network, they transmit with precision, 
Signaling messages with utmost provision.

Resilience is their key, in mechanisms they excel, 
Ensuring seamless transmission, they do it well. 
Strategically positioned, they secure their domain, 
Validating and verifying, resilience they maintain.

Efficiency is their game, in operations they thrive, 
Disseminating information to ensure it arrives. 
Direct and rapid, their methods are clear, 
Efficiently transferring data, without any fear. 

Endocrine glands and Blockchain, a metaphorical tale, 
Efficient, resilient, and redundant, they never fail.
