      "comets": "Comets in the solar system rely on utilizing gravitational forces to determine their movement and path through space. They navigate the vastness of the cosmos by interacting with the gravitational fields of celestial bodies.",
      "repulsor_technology": "Similarly, Repulsor technology in Iron Man operates on the basis of utilizing gravitational forces. It allows Iron Man to maneuver and fly through the air with precision, much like how Comets navigate through space using gravitational forces."

      "metaphor": "both Comets in solar system and Repulsor technology in Iron Man have Material Science as a key design principle and mechanism",
      "comets": "Comets are composed of various materials, including icy materials and dust particles. Scientists study and manipulate these materials to understand their properties and how they behave in different environments within the solar system.",
      "repulsor_technology": "In a similar vein, Repulsor technology in Iron Man involves the study and manipulation of materials to create the powerful energy sources that enable the functionality of the Repulsors. This mirrors the studying and use of materials in Comets to understand their properties and how they interact with their surroundings."
