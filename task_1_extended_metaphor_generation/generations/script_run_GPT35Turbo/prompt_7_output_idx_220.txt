Like the atmosphere's gases finely mixed,
Music production in Kpop is fixed.
Balanced blend in both forms of art,
Creating harmony from the start.

A well-designed system, geometric in sight,
Regulating gases, producing hits just right.
Each component plays a role, unique,
Keeping equilibrium, ensuring a winning streak.

A harmonious environment they strive to create,
Supporting life, artistic expression, no debate.
Specific ratios of gases, musical elements combined,
In atmosphere and music, balance intertwined.
