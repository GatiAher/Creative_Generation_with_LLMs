DNA can be compared to money through the lens of a metaphorical comparison with blockchain technology. Genes in DNA act as the blueprints for creating proteins, providing detailed instructions on how to build and organize them, much like how blockchain in money relies on underlying code and consensus mechanisms to dictate the creation, validation, and recording of transactions in a structured and transparent manner.

Similarly, nucleotides in DNA and blockchain in money exhibit modularity as a key design principle, breaking down genetic information and financial transactions into foundational geometric units for organized storage and transmission. Redundancy is also present in both nucleotides and blockchain, ensuring the robust encoding, replication, and storage of genetic instructions and financial records.

Chromosomes in DNA and blockchain in money both feature an architectural blueprint that guides the overall plan and organization of information within a system. They efficiently store and organize data to maximize space and resources, with a complex array of structural components working together to achieve specific functions within the system.

Furthermore, the double helix structure of DNA and blockchain technology enhance stability, redundancy, data density, and modularity in storing and organizing genetic information and financial transactions. Just as the double helix encodes genetic information along its intertwined spirals, blockchain splits data into blocks that are linked together for easy verification and updating without compromising the integrity of the entire chain.
