Subduction zones and groundskeeping alike,
Recycling and renewal, they both invite.
One crust slides beneath another, they say,
Creating new landforms in their own special way.

Convergent boundaries, where components converge,
Density and composition differences emerge.
Oceanic crust sinking beneath continental so deep,
Trenches and volcanic arcs form while we sleep.

In baseball, the infield meets the outfield with grace,
Grooming and maintaining, ensuring a smooth playing space.
Recycling materials to keep the field pristine,
A safe and playable surface, a groundskeeper's scene.

Subduction and groundskeeping, processes intertwined,
Old crust recycled, new landforms to find.
Both exhibit destruction and creation so fair,
Renewal and recycling, a natural pair.
