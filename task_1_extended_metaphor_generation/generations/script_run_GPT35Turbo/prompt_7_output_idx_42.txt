Just as the naked singularity bends,
Defying laws and rules without ends.
The Arc Reactor in Iron Man's chest,
Breaks barriers, powering at its best.

Both challenge the norm, with infinite might,
Infinite values, breaking free from the light.
Limits explored, in structures extreme,
Defying the laws, in a dynamic scheme.
