Creating a Kpop music video is like thermal energy,
Quantifying creative input and heat transfer synergy.
Just as particles move in a system's flow,
Artistic elements in music videos glow.

The internal dynamics and energy transformations align,
With team members' skills combining to shine.
Heat transfer in both realms plays a vital role,
From kinetic energy to visual expressions that console.

So just like Thermodynamics in energy's domain,
Music video production in Kpop is a creative chain.
Both involve understanding dynamics and flow,
To create captivating works that fans love and know.
