Lava in volcano, like Kpop choreography,
Both with heat and density as their key strategy.
Flowing fluidly through paths of least resistance,
Creating energy release and visual brilliance.

Just as lava rises and flows with lighter weight,
Choreography moves gracefully, never second rate.
With fluid movements and dynamic transitions,
Expressing music with creative renditions.
