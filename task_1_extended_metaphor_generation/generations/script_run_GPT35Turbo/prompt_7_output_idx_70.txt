In the DNA's code, instruction lines flow,
Blueprints in genes, like J.A.R.V.I.S. they show.
Organized sequences, structured and true,
Guiding proteins and heroes in all that they do.

Just as genes organize genetic fate,
J.A.R.V.I.S. arranges data at a rapid rate.
Both with blueprints and sequences to guide,
In DNA and Iron Man, functions coincide.
