Like Event Horizon in space's domain,
Home Plate in baseball's a boundary plain.
Both mark a limit, capture all within,
Defined by radius, with spacetime's bend.

A black hole's pull prevents escape,
While Home Plate stops players' race.
Bound by math and physics, they stand,
Barriers crucial in their own brand.
