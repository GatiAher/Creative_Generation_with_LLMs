Stable Isotope Analysis and Sabermetrics,
Mathematical modeling, geometric tricks.
Structured approach, predictive trends,
In data analysis, both have their ends.

Visualizing data with geometric ease,
Deriving insights, making strategies breeze.
Patterns, correlations, anomalies found,
In isotopic compositions, in plays abound.

Predictive models for informed decisions,
Forecasting outcomes, precision visions.
Stable Isotope Analysis, Sabermetrics unite,
In the realm of data, shining bright.
