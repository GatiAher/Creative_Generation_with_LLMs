Isotope Fractionation and Arc Reactor,
Both leverage atomic properties, the X-factor.
Separating isotopes and elements with care,
For analysis and energy to prepare.

Behavior discrepancies, they both heed,
To study deeper, to succeed.
Isotopes and elements, with traits unique,
Unlocking mysteries, answers to seek.

Like Isotope Fractionation in its prime,
Arc Reactor powers Iron Man in time.
Recognizing discrepancies, a key skill,
For analysis and power, they apply with will.
