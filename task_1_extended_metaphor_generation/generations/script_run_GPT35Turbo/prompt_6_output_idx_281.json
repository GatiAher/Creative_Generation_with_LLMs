      "metaphor": "both Volcanic Vent in volcano and Pitcher's mound in baseball have a mechanism for creating a pathway for the release of pressure and gases to prevent explosive eruptions",
      "volcanic_vent": "The Volcanic Vent functions as a crucial release valve for the built-up pressure and gases beneath the Earth's crust, preventing catastrophic explosions by providing a controlled pathway for their safe release.",
      "pitcher's_mound": "Similarly, the Pitcher's mound serves as the starting point for the pitcher to release built-up energy in the form of a pitch, allowing controlled and strategic delivery of the ball to prevent wild and erratic throws."

      "metaphor": "both Volcanic Vent in volcano and Pitcher's mound in baseball have a geometric design that utilizes an opening to allow materials to rise with minimized resistance",
      "volcanic_vent": "The Volcanic Vent is geometrically designed with a narrow conduit that enables magma, ash, and gases to ascend to the surface efficiently, minimizing resistance and facilitating their smooth movement upwards.",
      "pitcher's_mound": "Likewise, the Pitcher's mound is constructed with a specific geometry that aids the pitcher in generating power and accuracy in their throws, allowing the ball to move towards the batter with less resistance and optimal force."
