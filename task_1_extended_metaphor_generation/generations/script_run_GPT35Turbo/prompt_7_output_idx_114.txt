Like a catalyst in a reaction, 
Or an Arc Reactor's attraction,
Optimization is their shared goal,
To simplify and calibrate the soul.

Efficiency is key, in chemical or tech,
Recalibrating energy with a respectful peck,
To achieve the pinnacle, the ultimate peak,
With minimal input, they always seek. 

Both Catalyst and Arc Reactor's role,
To simplify and optimize to reach the ultimate goal.
