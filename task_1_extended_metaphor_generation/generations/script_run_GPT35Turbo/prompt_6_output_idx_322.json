      "metaphor": "Just as Potential Energy stores energy in an object based on its spatial orientation, like a vault holding precious treasures waiting to be unlocked. Gravitational Potential Energy, akin to a mighty mountain, holds more power when positioned higher in the gravitational field.",
      "potential_energy": "The purpose of Potential Energy is to harness the hidden power within objects, waiting for the perfect moment to unleash it into motion. Its mechanism works like a coiled spring, ready to jump into action when released.",
      "flight_technology_with_repulsor_energy": "Similarly, Flight technology with repulsor energy in Iron Man functions as a beacon of power, storing energy within the suit ready to propel its wearer into the sky. The repulsor technology mirrors the conversion of Potential Energy to Kinetic Energy, as it transforms stored energy into the propulsion needed for flight."
