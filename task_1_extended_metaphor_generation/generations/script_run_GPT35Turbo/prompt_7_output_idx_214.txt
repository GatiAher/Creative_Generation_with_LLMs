Cluster Computing and J.A.R.V.I.S.,
Divide and Conquer, they both miss.
Breaking down tasks, into bits so small,
Efficient processing, they stand tall.

Parallel Processing, they also share,
Multiple nodes, for tasks to bear.
Concurrent work, for speed and might,
Handling demands, day and night.

Load Balancing, another trait in hand,
Efficient distribution, as they command.
Utilizing resources, in a seamless flow,
Completing tasks, with a steady glow.

Like Cluster Computing and J.A.R.V.I.S. in tandem,
Efficient mechanisms, they both fathom.
Dividing, processing, balancing right,
In the world of tech, they shine so bright.
