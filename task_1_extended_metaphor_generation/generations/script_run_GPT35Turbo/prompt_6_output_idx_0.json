      "metaphor": "both Planets in the solar system and Choreography in Kpop have Orbital Configurations",
      "planets": "Orbital configurations in the solar system result in stable interactions between celestial bodies, maintaining the gravitational equilibrium and stability of the system.",
      "choreography": "In Choreography in Kpop, stable configurations of dancers on stage enhance the visual impact and dynamic flow of the performance, contributing to the overall aesthetic appeal and balance of the choreographed piece."
