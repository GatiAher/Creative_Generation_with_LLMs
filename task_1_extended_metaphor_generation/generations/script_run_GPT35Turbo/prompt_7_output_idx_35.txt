Like Dark Matter in space's vast expanse,
Security in money, they dance.
Both provide redundancy and support,
Keeping galaxies and finances in consort.

Resilient to external force they stand,
Holding structures as if by hand.
Dark Matter in the cosmos above,
Security in money, a shield against push and shove.
