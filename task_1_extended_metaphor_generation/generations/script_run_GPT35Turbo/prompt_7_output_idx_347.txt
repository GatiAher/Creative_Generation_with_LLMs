In the realm of physics and finance's land,
Angular momentum and Compound Interest stand.
Like Moment of Inertia for rotation's might,
Initial investment's mass shapes Compound Interest's flight.

Angular Velocity, the rate objects spin,
Combined with Moment of Inertia, a system to win.
Likewise in finance, with interest's rotation,
Frequency of compounding shapes wealth's creation.

So in understanding these systems in kind,
Moment of Inertia and Initial Investment we find.
Angular Velocity and Compounding Frequency,
Key principles shaping our reality.
