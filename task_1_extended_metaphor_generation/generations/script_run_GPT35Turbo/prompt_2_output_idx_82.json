  "purpose": "Thermal Energy serves as a form of energy storage within a system to account for the internal interactions and motion of its constituent particles.",
  "mechanism": "Thermal Energy is a manifestation of the kinetic energy of particles within a system, which results from their vibrational, rotational, and translational motions. This energy is quantified by the particles' temperature and their specific heat capacities, embodying the system's overall internal dynamics."
