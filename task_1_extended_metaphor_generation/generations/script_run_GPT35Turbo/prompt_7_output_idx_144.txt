Isomerism and Kpop subunits, akin in their ways,
Optimizing structures for specific displays.
Rearranging atoms or members within,
Creating variations for new configurations to begin.

Just like molecules with forms unique,
Subunits in Kpop bring talents to peak.
Distinct geometric configurations they hold,
Offering diverse styles, appealing to manifold.

Adjusting structures for specific intents,
Both concepts employ varied extents.
Engineering designs for functionalities distinct,
Isomerism and subunits, a creative sync.
