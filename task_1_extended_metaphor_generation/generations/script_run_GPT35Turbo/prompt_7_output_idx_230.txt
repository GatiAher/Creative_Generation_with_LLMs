In the atmosphere's dance so grand,
And in Iron Man's high-tech land,
Temperature's control they command,
With systems intricate and well-planned.

Like Atmospheric Circulation's art,

In regulating heat with heart,
Global energy they both impart.

From wind patterns to transport heat,
Complex systems they discreetly greet,
Ensuring balance, making fleet,
They distribute energy complete.
