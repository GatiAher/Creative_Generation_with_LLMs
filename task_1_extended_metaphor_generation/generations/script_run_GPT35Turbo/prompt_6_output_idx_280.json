      "metaphor": "both Volcanic Vent in volcano and Dynamic Choreography in Kpop have Pressure Release as a core design principle and mechanism",
      "volcanic_vent": "The Volcanic Vent functions as a crucial pathway that allows the built-up pressure and gases beneath the Earth's crust to escape gradually, thus preventing potentially catastrophic explosive eruptions.",
      "dynamic_choreography": "Similar to the Volcanic Vent, Dynamic Choreography in Kpop serves as an outlet for the pent-up energy and creativity of the performers. It provides a structured release for the intense emotions and movements, preventing any 'explosive' outbursts on stage."

      "metaphor": "both Volcanic Vent in volcano and Dynamic Choreography in Kpop have Geometric Design as a key principle and mechanism",
      "volcanic_vent": "The Geometric Design of the Volcanic Vent involves the use of a geometrically shaped opening that allows magma, ash, and gases to ascend to the surface through a narrow conduit, reducing resistance and facilitating their safe release.",
      "dynamic_choreography": "Similarly, Dynamic Choreography in Kpop incorporates precise geometric formations and movements to guide the flow of energy and expressions among the dancers. The strategic placement and sequencing of steps minimize any conflicts or resistance within the performance, ensuring a smooth and impactful presentation."
