"""{{Parallel computing}} is akin to breaking down complex {{geometric problems}} into smaller, manageable parts that can be solved simultaneously. This approach allows for faster computation by harnessing the combined power of multiple processors to tackle different aspects of a problem concurrently. In {{parallel computing}}, multiple processing units work together to divide a large {{computational task}} into smaller sub-tasks, each handling a portion of the overall workload. Each processor operates independently and communicates with others to collectively arrive at a solution. This division of labor and collaborative effort among processors expedite the overall computation process, mirroring the efficiency gained in [engineering] and [design] when different specialists concurrently contribute to different aspects of a project."""
