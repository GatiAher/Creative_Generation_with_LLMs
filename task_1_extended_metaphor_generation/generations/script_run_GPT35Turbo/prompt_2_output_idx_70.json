  "purpose": "The Volcanic Vent serves as a pathway for the release of pressure and gases from beneath the Earth's crust to prevent a buildup that could result in explosive eruptions.",
  "mechanism": "The Volcanic Vent is a geometric opening that allows magma, ash, and gases to rise to the surface. Its design includes a narrow conduit that directs the volcanic materials upwards, minimizing resistance and facilitating the flow of materials out of the volcano."
