In the polar vortex and Central Bank's domain,
Buffer zones and stability they both maintain.
Stratosphere controls cold, winds in the sky,
Central Bank regulates money to keep economy high.

A stable layer they create, influencing patterns,
Whether in temperature or in financial matters.
Unique structure allows containment and control,
Of atmospheric phenomena and economic goal.
