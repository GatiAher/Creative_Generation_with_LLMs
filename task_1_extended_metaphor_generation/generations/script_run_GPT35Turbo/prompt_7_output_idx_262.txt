Just like the Jet Stream in its course,
Or Repulsor tech in Iron Man's force,
Dynamic boundaries they do define,
Separating regions, a line so fine.

Concentrating energy to transport afar,
Efficient and swift, like a shooting star,
From poles to equator, from land to sea,
In weather systems or battles, they both decree.

High winds form along their boundary line,
Contributing to structure, so refined,
Regulating patterns, global and great,
Both in atmosphere and superhero's fate.
