RESTful API and Kpop collaborations,
Modularity and Standardization as foundations.
Just like dividing a system into parts,
Or artists coming together with their distinct arts.

Hierarchy in order, from important to least,
Structured relationships that make communication feast.
In API or in Kpop, roles are defined,
To ensure success in a structured design.

Clear communication, rules and formats abound,
In both worlds, it's the key to sound.
From data exchange to sharing ideas,
It makes collaboration a harmonious breeze.
