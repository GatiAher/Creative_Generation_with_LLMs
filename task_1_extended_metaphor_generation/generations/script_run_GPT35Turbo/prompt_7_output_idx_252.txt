In Kpop MVs and topographic maps we see,
Contour lines and choreography,
Define the landscape, show elevation,
Creating dynamic visual sensation.

Shading techniques, light and shadow play,
Enhancing the visuals in their own way,
In maps and videos, depth and drama enhance,
Creating a truly immersive trance.
