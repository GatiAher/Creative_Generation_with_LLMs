Like a black hole in the sky,
Or the strike zone in baseball high,
Both create a space,
With a boundary in place,
Where gravity's pull is strong,
And nothing can escape for long. 

In the depths of the cosmos,
Or on the diamond's green moss,
The event horizon's grip,
Or the strike zone's tight script,
Defines the limits of play,
In their concentrated display.
