In the code's complex maze we delve,
Debugging akin to solving math's spell.
Systematic steps must be taken,
To find errors and fix what's broken.

Audits in money, a logical quest,
Examining transactions to be at their best.
Logical reasoning, a crucial tool,
To pinpoint errors and keep finances cool.

Testing methods for both are key,
Ensuring functionality, error-free.
To verify design and financial flow,
Debugging and Audit, a systematic show.
