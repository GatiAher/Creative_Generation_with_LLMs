      "comets": "Comets in the solar system utilize gravitational forces to determine their movement and path as they orbit the Sun. This gravitational interaction shapes their trajectories and influences their journey through space.",
      "pitch_spin_rate": "Similarly, Pitch Spin Rate in baseball harnesses the principles of physics to dictate the movement and trajectory of a pitched ball. The spin of the baseball creates aerodynamic forces that impact its path, giving pitchers control and variability in their pitches."

      "metaphor": "both Comets in the solar system and Pitch Spin Rate in baseball have similar characteristics in terms of Material Science",
      "comets": "In the study of Comets, scientists analyze the icy materials and dust particles that make up these celestial bodies to understand their properties and composition. By studying these materials, researchers can gain insights into the formation and evolution of comets in different environments.",
      "pitch_spin_rate": "Likewise, Pitch Spin Rate in baseball involves the manipulation and study of the baseball's materials to optimize its spin rate. Pitchers experiment with grip and release techniques to enhance the spin of the ball, affecting its movement and behavior as it approaches the batter."
