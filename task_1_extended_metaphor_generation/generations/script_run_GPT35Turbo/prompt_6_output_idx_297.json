      "plate_movements": "Plate Movements ensure balanced load distribution across the Earth's crust to prevent excessive stress accumulation and reduce the risk of seismic events.",
      "pitcher's_pitching_mechanics": "In Pitcher's pitching mechanics, maintaining a balanced load distribution across the body during the pitching motion is essential to prevent injuries, optimize performance, and minimize strain on specific muscle groups."
