In Parallel Computing and Iron Man's J.A.R.V.I.S. alike,
Divide and Conquer, Parallel Processing, Collaborative Engineering take flight.
Breaking problems into parts, working concurrently with grace,
Efficient utilization, enhanced performance, and collaboration embrace.
Just as systems divide tasks, optimize, and engineer with zeal,
So do Parallel Computing and J.A.R.V.I.S., make solutions real.
