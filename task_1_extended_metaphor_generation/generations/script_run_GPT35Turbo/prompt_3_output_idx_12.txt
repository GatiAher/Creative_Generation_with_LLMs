{{Black Holes}} serve the purpose of exhibiting extreme {{curvature}} in the spacetime fabric, allowing for the exploration of physics beyond conventional boundaries. {{Black Holes}} are designed with concentrated mass and density leading to intense gravitational pull that warps spacetime around them. This {{curvature}} prevents light from escaping due to the structure of the event horizon, forming a {{geometric}} boundary which traps matter and energy within.
