{{Distributed Systems}} act like a web of interconnected nodes, resembling a multifaceted [geometric] shape that ensures stability and reliability through redundancy and division of tasks among different entities. {{Distributed Systems}} incorporate nodes spread out like vertices of a mathematical graph, with each node responsible for specific computations or tasks. The communication and coordination between these nodes are facilitated using message passing mechanisms, akin to the lines connecting vertices on a polygon, ensuring seamless interaction and synchronization.
