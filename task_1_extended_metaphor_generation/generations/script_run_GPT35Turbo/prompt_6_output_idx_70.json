      "metaphor": "both Genes in DNA and J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man have blueprints that act as the guide providing a detailed plan and structure for their respective functions",
      "genes": "In DNA, blueprints are represented by the specific sequence of nucleotide bases that encode instructions for building proteins. These blueprints determine the sequence of amino acids in a protein, analogous to how architectural blueprints dictate the structure and design of a building.",
      "j.a.r.v.i.s.": "Similarly, J.A.R.V.I.S. operates based on a virtual blueprint of Tony Stark's preferences, strategies, and requirements. It uses this detailed plan to guide and assist Stark in various tasks, resembling the role of DNA blueprints in directing the synthesis of proteins."

      "metaphor": "both Genes in DNA and J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man have organized sequences within molecules that represent the arrangement of elements in a structured and systematic way",
      "genes": "In DNA, the organized sequences ensure specific segmentations and order of genetic information, allowing for accurate transcription and translation processes. This structured arrangement is crucial for the functioning and regulation of genes within an organism.",
      "j.a.r.v.i.s.": "On the other hand, J.A.R.V.I.S. organizes vast amounts of data and information into a systematic format for quick access and analysis. By maintaining a structured arrangement of data points, J.A.R.V.I.S. efficiently provides Stark with relevant information and support, much like the organized sequences in DNA facilitate proper gene expression and regulation."
