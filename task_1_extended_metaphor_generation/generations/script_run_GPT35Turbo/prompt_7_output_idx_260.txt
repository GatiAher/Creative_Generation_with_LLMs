Just like the Jet Stream in a polar vortex,
Both BTS Dynamite and weather patterns perplex.
They form boundaries that separate and divide,
Influencing behaviors and trends far and wide.

Concentrating energy efficiently across the sky,
Driving movements whether in music or up high.
High winds along boundaries, structuring the flow,
Regulating patterns, guiding where we go.
