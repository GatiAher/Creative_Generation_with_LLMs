Like Adrenal Glands in our system of health,
Choreography in Kpop maintains balance and stealth.
Both with sensors and actuators intertwined,
Responding dynamically, in sync and aligned.

Efficient communication, a key in their role,
Ensuring harmony, achieving the ultimate goal.
From stressors to music cues, they adapt and adjust,
Creating a performance that keeps us all entrust.
