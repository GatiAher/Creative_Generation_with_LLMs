Like a symphony of signals in the air,
Programming languages and umpire hand gestures pair.
Structured syntax and rules they share,
Communicating instructions with utmost care.

Just as symbols and conventions align,
In the digital realm and baseball design.
Standardized gestures and commands refine,
Complex information they both define. 

Consistent symbols and commands they employ,
In logical sequences, they both deploy.
From computer program to baseball's joy,
Precision and clarity they both enjoy.
