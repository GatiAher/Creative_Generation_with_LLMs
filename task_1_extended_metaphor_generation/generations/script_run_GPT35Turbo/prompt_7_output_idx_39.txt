Naked singularities and cryptocurrency alike,
Defy norms and boundaries, pushing limits to new height.
In physics and finance, they disrupt the known,
Exploring uncharted territories, where mysteries are sown.

Just as naked singularities roam free,
Cryptocurrencies offer financial liberty.
No event horizon or central control,
Both break free from the traditional mold.

Visible singularities in math and finance,
Open doors to exploration and advance.
These unique traits they both share,
Freedom from constraints, in their respective lairs.
