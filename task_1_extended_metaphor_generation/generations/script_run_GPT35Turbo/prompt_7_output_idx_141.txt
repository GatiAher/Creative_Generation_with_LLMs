Intermolecular bonds and pitching rotation,
Both rely on organization as their foundation.
Molecules packed efficiently, pitchers strategically placed,
Stability and structure in both cases embraced.

Utilizing forces to create interactions,
Whether molecular compounds or baseball rotations.
From dipole-dipole to favorable matchups,
Efficiency and success as their catchups.
