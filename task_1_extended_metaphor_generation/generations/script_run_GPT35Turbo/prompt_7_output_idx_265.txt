Like the stratosphere in a polar vortex,
The retractable roof in baseball rocks.
Both creating stable layers above,
To control and contain with love.

Buffer zones and modulation too,
Allow for containment, like the sky so blue.
Influencing temperature and wind,
Creating environments where games can begin.
