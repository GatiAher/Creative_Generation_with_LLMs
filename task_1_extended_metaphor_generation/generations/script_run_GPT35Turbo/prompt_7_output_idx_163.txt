In the realm of kinetics and finance we see,
A catalyst in chemistry, akin to algorithms in money spree,
Both speeding up reactions, be it molecular or trade,
Lowering barriers, in a strategic cascade.

Geometric configurations, strategically placed,
In catalytic reactions and trading race,
Optimizing efficiency, the ultimate goal,
In chemistry and finance, their roles do unfold.
