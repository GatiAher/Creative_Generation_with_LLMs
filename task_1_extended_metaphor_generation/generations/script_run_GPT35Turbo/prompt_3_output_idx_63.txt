"""{{Relief}} provides a visual understanding of the vertical dimension of terrain features, aiding in the interpretation of spatial relationships and elevations in a two-dimensional representation of the land. The {{Relief}} is structured using contour lines and shading techniques to depict the varying elevations and gradients across the terrain. By carefully spacing contour lines based on specific intervals of elevation difference, the {{Relief}} creates a visual representation of the topography's height and depth. Shading techniques, such as hachures and layering, further enhance the depiction of {{relief}} by simulating the effects of light and shadow on the terrain's surfaces based on their relative elevations."""
