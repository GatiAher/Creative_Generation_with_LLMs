Adrenal glands and J.A.R.V.I.S. stand,
Like sensors and actuators hand in hand.
One in the body, one in Iron Man's array,
Both maintain balance in their unique way.

Monitoring stress, adjusting hormone release,
Responding dynamically to find peace.
A network of sensors, specialized and keen,
Ensuring homeostasis, this dynamic machine.

Efficient communication, rapid and clear,
Ensures both systems remain near.
Adapting to stress, challenges they face,
Adrenal glands and J.A.R.V.I.S. embrace.
