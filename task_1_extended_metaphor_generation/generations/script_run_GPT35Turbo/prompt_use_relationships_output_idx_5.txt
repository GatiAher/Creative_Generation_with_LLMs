The Big Bang theory in cosmology can be likened to a baseball game, where each component plays a crucial role in shaping the overall narrative.

Just as Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation serves as a foundational blueprint for understanding the early stages and design of the universe, Pitch velocity tracking technology provides critical insight into a pitcher's performance and strategy in baseball.

Inflation Theory, with its initial phase of exponential expansion, is akin to the rapid growth of Expansion teams in baseball, both aiming to ensure a more uniform and competitive environment.

The Singularity in the Big Bang theory, characterized by compression and foundation establishment, mirrors the pitcher's motion in baseball, where energy is compressed and released with precision to set the stage for the game's progression.

Similarly, Dark Matter's role in providing additional stability to the universe reflects the Pitcher's mound in baseball, offering a stable foundation for pitchers to deliver accurate and controlled pitches, showcasing resilience in function under external pressures. 

In both realms, whether cosmic or sportive, these elements come together to create a harmonious and structured system that unfolds with complexity and grace.
