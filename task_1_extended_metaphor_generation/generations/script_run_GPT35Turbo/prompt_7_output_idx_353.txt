Like strings vibrating in hidden spaces,
Pitchers compactify their pitches in baseball bases.
Extra dimensions in theory, unseen yet vital,
Unified explanations in both fields, a concept so vital.

Compactification extends beyond three,
Pitch selection, a strategic key.
Hidden dimensions play a role,
Deception and unpredictability, the ultimate goal.

Unified explanations, the ultimate aim,
Connecting particles, or winning the game.
In superstring theory and baseball play,
Extra dimensions and pitch selection have their say.
