Just as thermal energy flows
Through systems high and low,
So too does the pitching speed
Release energy with every throw.

Thermodynamics measure heat
In particles' kinetic feat,
While pitching speed tracks the pace
Of a pitcher's dynamic embrace.

Vibrational, rotational spin
Both in energy and pitching win,
Transferring motion, transferring might
To optimize speed and flight.
