In the cosmic dance of creation's might,
Dark Matter and Choreography unite.
One supports the universe's vast expanse,
While the other ensures Kpop's elegant dance.

Like Dark Matter's unseen gravitational hand,
Choreography adds formations grand.
Both provide stability against external threats,
Keeping structures intact, no regrets.

Dark Matter's purpose in celestial domain,
Choreography's in performance reign.
Through precise mechanisms they both do toil,
Ensuring structure and beauty without recoil.
