{{Dark Matter}} acts as the unseen scaffolding that supports the structural integrity of the universe by providing additional gravitational force needed for galaxies and clusters to maintain their shapes and motion. {{Dark Matter}} is postulated to be composed of unique particles that possess mass but do not interact with light or electromagnetic forces - this unseen presence exerts gravitational effects on visible matter, providing the extra '[design support]' necessary for the universe's structure to hold together in accordance with the laws of [geometry] and physics.
