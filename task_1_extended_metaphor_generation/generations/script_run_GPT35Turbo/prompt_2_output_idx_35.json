  "purpose": "Intermolecular Forces serve to maximize stability and organization within molecular compounds, ensuring efficient packing and arrangement of molecules without directly altering the chemical identities of the molecules involved.",
  "mechanism": "Intermolecular Forces emerge from geometric and structural features of molecules, such as dipole-dipole interactions, Van der Waals forces, and hydrogen bonding. These forces function as interlocking mechanisms, akin to geometric puzzles or mathematical optimization, allowing molecules to find the most energetically favorable positions relative to each other in a given space."
