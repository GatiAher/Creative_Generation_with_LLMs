In DNA's coded code and Kpop's dance's beat,
Modularity reigns, making both complete.
Nucleotides' units, choreography's segments,
Organize and combine in creative descents.

Redundancy in structure, in both a must,
Ensures reliability, in DNA's trust.
Composite elements, dance vocab variety,
Robustness and repetition, creating dance society.

Precision in arrangement, a crucial part,
Of DNA's encoding, a complex art.
Choreography's placement, steps in line,
Creating a synchronized, visually divine.

Both worlds showcase a precision so rare,
In DNA's design, in Kpop's dance flair.
Modularity, redundancy, precision align,
In DNA and Kpop, a connection divine.
