"""The {{GraphQL API}} acts as a versatile [mathematical function] allowing a user to precisely specify the data and requirements they need in a single request, enabling efficient retrieval and manipulation of complex [geometric], [mathematical], and [design-related] information. The {{GraphQL API}} operates similar to a customizable [geometry calculator], where the user provides specific coordinates, equations, or constraints in the query language. The API then processes these inputs in a structured manner, retrieving and delivering only the requested data from the server-side runtime environment, allowing for streamlined communication and retrieval of [geometry], [math], [engineering], and [design] data."""
