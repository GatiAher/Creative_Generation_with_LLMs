Just as kinetic energy shows,
The force that objects in motion grows,
So too in Kpop, a boundless flow,
Of 'Performance energy' that makes the show.

With velocity squared, kinetic force,
Determines impact, a powerful source,
Likewise in Kpop, energy level high,
Reflects the charisma that catches the eye.

Calculating work, in both we see,
An energy principle, wild and free,
From moving objects to idols on stage,
Energy guides their dynamic rage.
