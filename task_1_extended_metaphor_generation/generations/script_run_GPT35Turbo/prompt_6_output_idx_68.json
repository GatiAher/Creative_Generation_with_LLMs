      "genes": "Genes in DNA function as the blueprints that contain the instructions for making proteins. They provide a detailed plan and structure for the construction of proteins, similar to architectural blueprints for buildings.",
      "choreography": "Similarly, Choreography in Kpop acts as the blueprint for the dance routines performed by the artists. It provides a detailed plan and structure for the dance moves, ensuring precise movements and sequences that contribute to the overall performance."

      "metaphor": "both Genes in DNA and Choreography in Kpop have Organized Sequences as the underlying design principle",
      "genes": "Genes in DNA consist of organized sequences within molecules that represent the arrangement of elements in a structured and systematic way. This ensures specific segmentations and order, crucial for the functioning of the genetic code.",
      "choreography": "Likewise, Choreography in Kpop involves organized sequences of dance steps that are meticulously planned and structured. These sequences ensure that each movement flows seamlessly into the next, creating a visually appealing and well-coordinated dance performance."
