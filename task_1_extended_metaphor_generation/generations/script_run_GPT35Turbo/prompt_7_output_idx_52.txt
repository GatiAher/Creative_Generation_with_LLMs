In Biome and K-pop collaborations,
Integration and interdependence are like revelations.
Just as species coexist and adapt in the wild,
Artists blend talents to create songs that beguile.

Efficiency and resilience, principles embraced,
In ecosystems and music collaborations, they're placed.
Maximizing resources, adapting to thrive,
Creating harmony and creativity to keep the drive.
