  "purpose": "Lewis Structures serve as visual blueprints for predicting and understanding the spatial arrangement and bonding patterns within molecules, enabling engineers and designers to model molecular interactions and behaviors with precision.",
  "mechanism": "Lewis Structures indicate the positions of atom connections and shared electron pairs in a molecule using lines and dots, allowing for the visualization of geometric relationships and electron distributions. By representing the electronic framework of molecules in a 2D format, engineers and designers can analyze and manipulate molecular structures in a systematic way."
