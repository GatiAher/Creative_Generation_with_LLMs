Stable Isotope Analysis and Machine Learning,
Both use math and geometry for data gleaning.
Patterns and anomalies they seek to find,
Structured approaches in their minds they bind.

Predictive models they design with care,
To forecast trends and market fare.
In isotopes and money, the parallels shine,
Analyzing data, they intertwine.
