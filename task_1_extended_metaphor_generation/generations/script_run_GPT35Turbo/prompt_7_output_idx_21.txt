Just as the Big Bang's inception,
Cosmic radiation offers a crucial connection.
In baseball, velocity tracking is the key,
Providing insight for pitchers to see.

Through uniformity and isotropy,
Residual signals offer clarity.
Whether studying the universe's birth,
Or helping pitchers improve their worth.

Initial conditions provide a glimpse,
Of early stages for careful hints.
From the cosmos to the baseball field,
Blueprints provide knowledge to yield.
