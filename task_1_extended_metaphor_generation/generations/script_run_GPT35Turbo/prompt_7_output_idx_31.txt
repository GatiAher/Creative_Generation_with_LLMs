In the cosmos of creation and transactional play,
Singularity and Cryptocurrency find their way.
Compression, the force that binds them tight,
Condensing matter and data with power and might.

Foundation Establishment, a crucial bridge,
From compressed state to laws that give a ridge.
In the big bang and crypto's realm so vast,
A solid groundwork ensures systems will last.

Structuring, defining points in space-time,
Infinite density, a beginning sublime.
Both universes, expanding and verifying,
In structured foundations, their essence undying.
