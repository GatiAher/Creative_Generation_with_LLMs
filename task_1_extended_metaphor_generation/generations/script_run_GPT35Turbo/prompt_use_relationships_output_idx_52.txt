Topographic maps and Kpop can be likened to each other through a striking extended metaphor. Just as contour lines in topographic maps serve to visually represent the shape and elevation changes of the land surface, music videos in Kpop are designed to visually represent the artists' message, performance, and style in a concise and visually appealing manner. Both contour lines and music videos focus on visualization, simplification, connectivity, regularization, and dimensionality reduction.

Similarly, scale in topographic maps and global fan interaction in Kpop share the characteristic of enabling proportionate measurement and accurate representation of physical distance. Both emphasize ratio and consistency to denote the relationship between measurements for uniform scaling of distances and dimensions.

Further, legend in topographic maps and lightstick designs in Kpop follow the design principles of symbolization and standardization. In legend design, symbolization categorizes symbols by type and aids in clear interpretation, akin to how lightstick designs categorize symbols like logos and colors for identification and visual connection.

Additionally, topographic profiles in topographic maps and choreography mapping in Kpop prioritize detailed visualization, cross-sectional representation, and geometric analysis. Topographic profiles offer a visual representation of elevation changes, while choreography mapping visualizes dance sequences for a better understanding of choreography dynamics.

Lastly, relief in topographic maps and MV (Music Video) Production Techniques in Kpop both utilize contour lines that define their landscapes and shading techniques to enhance their visual impact. Contour lines in topographic maps help viewers understand the relief of a terrain, similar to how choreography in music videos outlines the dance sequences. Shading techniques in both cases add depth and atmosphere to the visual representation, enhancing the overall experience for the audience.
