Like lava in a volcano,
And a pitching mound in baseball,
Both distribute heat with a flow,
Controlled release in a controlled way, after all.

With density contrast, they rise,
Lava through fractures, mound against resistance,
Stability maintained under the skies,
Consistency assured, no matter the instance.

Fluid flow guides their path,
Buoyancy for lava, fluid mechanics for pitch,
Seeking least resistance in wrath,
Adjusting trajectory and speed, a perfect pitch.
