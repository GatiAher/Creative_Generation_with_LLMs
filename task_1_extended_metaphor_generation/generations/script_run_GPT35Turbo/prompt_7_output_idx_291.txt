In Earth's crust, subduction zones lie,
Where old materials are recycled to the sky.
Cryptocurrency, too, follows suit,
Using decentralized networks to compute.

Just as plates slide beneath with might,
Creating new landforms in the light,
Cryptocurrencies validate, create anew,
Renewing digital assets, transactions to pursue.

Both systems recycle, destroy the past,
Creating new forms that will last.
Subduction Zones and Cryptocurrency, they show,
The beauty of renewal in systems that flow.
