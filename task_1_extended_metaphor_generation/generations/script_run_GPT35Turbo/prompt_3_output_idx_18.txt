"{{Nucleotides}}" serve as the foundational [geometric] units in the design of DNA, enabling the storage and transmission of vital genetic information in an organized manner. "{{Nucleotides}}" are structured as a composite entity comprising a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base, forming a robust [geometric] framework. This arrangement allows for the precise encoding and replication of genetic instructions at the molecular level, resembling an intricately designed [engineering] system with [mathematical] precision.
