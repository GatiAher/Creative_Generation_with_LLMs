In chemistry's dance with catalysts, 
And baseball's art of frame,
Both seek strategic geometry,
For optimized efficiency's gain.

Like a catalyst speeds up reactions,
Or a catcher frames a pitch just right,
Specialized agents in formation,
Enhance outcomes in their own light.

Geometric configurations guide the way,
For smoother paths and better plays,
Designing for efficiency, both strive,
In chemical kinetics and baseball's drive.
