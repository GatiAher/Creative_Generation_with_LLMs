Like the Arc Reactor in Iron Man's tale,
Inflation Theory in the universe's scale.
Both emphasize exponential growth,
Creating balance and uniformity, both.

Just as Tony Stark's invention powers his suit,
Inflation Theory's mysterious energy source is astute.
Expanding swiftly, smoothing out space,
Ensuring a consistent, structured place.

In Iron Man and the cosmos, we see,
The power of exponential expansion, key.
Both strive for a flat and uniform realm,
In their respective worlds, at the helm.
