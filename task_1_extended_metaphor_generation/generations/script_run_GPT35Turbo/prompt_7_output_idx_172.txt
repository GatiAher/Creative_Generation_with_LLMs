In Kpop's collaboration, like software dev's creation,
Modularity and Hierarchy form a strong foundation.
Each member like a module, contributes their part,
Creating harmonious performances from the heart.

Just as code is structured in a modular way,
Kpop groups excel when their talents display.
Hierarchy ensures roles are defined and clear,
Resulting in music that fans hold dear.
