Singularities and Kpop in a tango,
Both breaking down structured norms in their flow.
Mathematical models hit a snag,
While Kpop dances in a complex choreography bag.

Pushing the limits, showcasing the flaws,
In existing frameworks, breaking laws.
Infinite values and extreme structures collide,
Highlighting the boundaries where frameworks hide.
