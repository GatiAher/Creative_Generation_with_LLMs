In ecosystems and Kpop, we see,
Redundancy and diversity key.
Like species in nature, groups in harmony,
Interconnected, robust, creativity spree.

Ecosystems thrive with layers of interaction,
Just like Kpop collabs, a musical attraction.
Diverse talents in unity, a colorful faction,
Interconnected creativity, a shared satisfaction.
