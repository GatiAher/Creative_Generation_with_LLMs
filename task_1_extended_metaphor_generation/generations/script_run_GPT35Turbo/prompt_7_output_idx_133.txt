Just like Lewis Structures in chemistry,
And Pitch Visualization in baseball,
Both rely on visual blueprints,
To predict and model interactions in detail.

Lines and dots in Lewis Structures,
Geometric representations in Pitch Visualization,
2D structural analysis in both fields,
Help unravel spatial arrangements with precision.

Chemists analyze molecules,
Batters anticipate pitches,
Using visual tools and insights,
To make informed decisions with ease.
