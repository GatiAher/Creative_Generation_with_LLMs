Reaction rate and Pitch prediction,
Mathematical modeling is the key depiction.
In chemistry or on the baseball field,
Equations and data yield insights revealed.

Predictive modeling guides the way,
Forecasting outcomes day by day.
Chemical reactions or pitcher's throw,
Anticipating results to know.

Optimization plays a crucial role,
Maximizing efficiency is the goal.
Finding the best conditions to enhance,
Success in reaction or pitch stance.

Just as in the lab or on the mound,
Modeling principles can always be found.
Whether it's chemistry or sports at play,
Optimizing, predicting, improving each day.
