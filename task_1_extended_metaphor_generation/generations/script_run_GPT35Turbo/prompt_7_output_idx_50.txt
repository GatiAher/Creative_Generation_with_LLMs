Like a black hole's intense gravity's sway,
The Arc Reactor in Iron Man at bay,
Both hide their power, contained in a dense display,
With a concentration of mass and density, they play. 

Just like an event horizon's tight hold,
The Arc Reactor's boundary, bold,
Trapping the energy, yet never cold,
Both creations of power, stories untold.
