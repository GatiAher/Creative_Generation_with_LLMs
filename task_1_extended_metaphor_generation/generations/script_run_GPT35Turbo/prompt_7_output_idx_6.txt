Moons dance in gravity's embrace,
Balancing planets with gentle grace.
In Iron Man's suit, Repulsor beams,
Orbital mechanics guide his schemes.

Stabilizing forces, equilibrium found,
In the cosmic ballet, a celestial sound.
Both Moons and tech, in harmony spin,
Gravitational balance, a dance within.
