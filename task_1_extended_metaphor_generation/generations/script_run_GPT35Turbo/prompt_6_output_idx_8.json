      "metaphor": "both Asteroids in solar system and Choreography in Kpop have Gravitational Forces",
      "asteroids": "In the solar system, gravitational forces are essential for maintaining the balance of planetary systems. Asteroids interact with these forces to either maintain their orbits or get pulled into the gravitational pull of larger celestial bodies.",
      "choreography": "Similarly, in Kpop choreography, dancers utilize the force of movement and coordination to create a harmonious and visually appealing performance. Choreographers ensure stability and balance by strategically positioning dancers and movements, just like how gravitational forces interact with celestial bodies to ensure stability."

      "metaphor": "both Asteroids in solar system and Choreography in Kpop have Orbital Mechanics",
      "asteroids": "Orbital mechanics play a crucial role in organizing the positions and movements of asteroids in the solar system. Different orbits are utilized to influence the trajectories and interactions of these celestial bodies.",
      "choreography": "In Kpop choreography, dancers move in various orbits within the performance space to create visually engaging patterns and formations. Different movements and positions are orchestrated to influence the flow and dynamics of the choreography, similar to how orbital mechanics influence the positions and interactions of asteroids in the solar system."
