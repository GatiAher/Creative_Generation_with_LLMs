Just as a Kpop team with a job for each,
GraphQL API follows a similar reach.
Single Responsibility keeps things clear,
Efficiently retrieving, with no need to fear.

Modularity, like Kpop's diverse teams,
Allows for remixes and multiple themes.
Different aspects, each with their part,
Separating concerns for a customizable start.

In Kpop, feedback on lyrics and more,
Separation of Concerns, keeping things in store.
Just like GraphQL, fetching only what's needed,
Streamlining communication, all data conceded.
