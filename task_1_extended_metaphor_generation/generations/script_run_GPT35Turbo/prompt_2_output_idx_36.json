  "purpose": "Isomerism enables the optimization of molecular structures to achieve different properties and functions, similar to designing multiple variations of a product for specific purposes.",
  "mechanism": "Isomerism arises through rearranging the atoms within a molecule while maintaining the same overall composition. This rearrangement can create distinct geometric configurations that result in varied physical and chemical properties, akin to different engineering designs for different functionalities."
