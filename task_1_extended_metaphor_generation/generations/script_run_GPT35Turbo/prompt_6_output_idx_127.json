      "endothermic_reaction": "In an Endothermic Reaction, external thermal energy is absorbed to maintain or increase the stability of the system by facilitating chemical changes.",
      "stability": "Similarly, in the realm of money, Stability is achieved by utilizing external factors to ensure the financial system remains steady and secure. Just as heat energy is consumed from the surroundings in an Endothermic Reaction, Stability in money involves absorbing and managing external influences to keep the monetary system secure and consistent."

      "metaphor": "both Endothermic Reaction in chemical reaction and Stability in money involve the transfer of heat energy from the surroundings to facilitate internal changes",
      "endothermic_reaction": "During an Endothermic Reaction, heat energy is transferred from the surroundings into the system to facilitate changes in the internal configuration, ultimately promoting stability.",
      "stability": "Similarly, in the financial world, Stability in money relies on the concept of Heat Transfer, where external factors provide the necessary energy to drive internal adjustments that ensure financial stability. The consumption of heat energy from the surroundings in an Endothermic Reaction is mirrored in the financial realm by the need to absorb external influences to bring about necessary changes for maintaining stability in money."
