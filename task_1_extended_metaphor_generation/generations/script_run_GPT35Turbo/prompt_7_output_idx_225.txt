In the atmosphere, layers set the stage,
Dividing regions, weather to gauge.
Just like in baseball, innings divide,
Analyzing players, strategies to guide.

Both with modularity as their aim,
Efficient control, segmentation their game.
Hierarchy in layers, divisions clear,
Understanding phenomena, analyzing near.

Boundary delimitation, marking the way,
Transition zones, where changes may sway.
In baseball, boundaries between plays,
Moments of decision, in strategic displays. 

Atmospheric layers, innings in play,
Design principles, guiding their way.
