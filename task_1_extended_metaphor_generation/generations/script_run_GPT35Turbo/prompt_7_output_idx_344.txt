Just like a spinning top resists sway,
Angular momentum in play,
Choreography in Kpop, they say,
Both have Moment of Inertia to display.

Rotational motion's key,
Inertia's role, you see,
Angular Velocity, with glee,
Guides the pace, dancers agree.

In Kpop's art, a symphony,
Angular momentum and Choreography,
Linked through physics' harmony,
In motion and dance, a unity.
