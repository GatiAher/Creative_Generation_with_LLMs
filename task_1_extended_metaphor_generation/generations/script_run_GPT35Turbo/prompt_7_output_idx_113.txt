Like a catalyst in a reaction, 
Or a pitcher on the mound,
Optimization is the key,
In speeding up what's found.

Lowering barriers, enhancing efficiency,
In both chemistry and sport,
Simplifying the process,
To achieve the desired report.

From chemical bonds to baseball plays,
The guiding principles align,
With optimization and simplification,
Both aiming to refine.

So whether in a test tube or on the field,
The goal remains the same,
To reach peak performance,
And win the optimization game.
