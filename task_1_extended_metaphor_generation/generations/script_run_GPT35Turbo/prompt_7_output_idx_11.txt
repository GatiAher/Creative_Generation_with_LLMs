Both asteroids and blockchain, 
Utilize forces to maintain reign. 
In space, gravity keeps order intact, 
While in finance, protocols ensure no act. 
Orbital mechanics guide the stars above, 
Consensus mechanisms secure transactions with love. 
So whether in space or in money's domain, 
For stability and security, these forces reign.
