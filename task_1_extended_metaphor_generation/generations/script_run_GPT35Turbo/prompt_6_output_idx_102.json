      "metaphor": "Both Adrenal Glands in the endocrine system and J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man have Feedback Control mechanisms that maintain homeostasis by dynamically responding to external stressors and internal conditions through interconnected sensors and actuators.",
      "adrenal_glands": "Adrenal Glands play a crucial role in the body by responding to stress signals and regulating hormone levels to help the body adapt to different situations. They continuously monitor stress levels and adjust hormone secretion to maintain balance.",
      "j.a.r.v.i.s._(just_a_rather_very_intelligent_system)": "Similarly, J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man functions as an intelligent system that constantly monitors external threats and internal conditions. It dynamically responds to Tony Stark's needs, providing real-time information and support to help him navigate challenging situations and maintain control."

      "metaphor": "Both Adrenal Glands in the endocrine system and J.A.R.V.I.S. in Iron Man employ a Sensor-Actuator System using specialized receptors to detect changes in stress levels, metabolism, and blood pressure.",
      "adrenal_glands": "Adrenal Glands are equipped with specialized receptors that sense variations in stress levels, metabolism, and blood pressure. These sensors send signals to the glands, triggering the release of hormones to manage the body's physiological response.",
      "j.a.r.v.i.s._(just_a_rather_very_intelligent_system)": "Likewise, J.A.R.V.I.S. uses a network of sensors interconnected with various components of Tony Stark's suit to detect threats, changes in environment, and Tony's health status. These sensors provide real-time data, enabling J.A.R.V.I.S. to activate defenses or assist Tony as needed."

      "adrenal_glands": "Adrenal Glands are strategically located within the body to facilitate rapid communication and response to stress signals. The efficient communication network ensures quick adjustments in hormone secretion to restore balance.",
      "j.a.r.v.i.s._(just_a_rather_very_intelligent_system)": "In a similar manner, J.A.R.V.I.S. is strategically designed to have communication nodes across Tony Stark's suit and lab, enabling quick data exchange and decision-making. This efficient communication system allows J.A.R.V.I.S. to coordinate actions and provide timely support to ensure Tony's well-being and success."
