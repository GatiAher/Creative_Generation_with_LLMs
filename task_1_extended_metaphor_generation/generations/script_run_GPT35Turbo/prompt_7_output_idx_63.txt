In nature's realm and financial space,
Habitats and DeFi find their place.
Geometric optimization they both embrace,
Efficient resource use as their base.

Interconnected patterns, complex networks they weave,
Creating systems where organisms thrive and transactions heave.
In ecosystems and DeFi, the design does not deceive,
Efficiency and connectivity they both achieve.
