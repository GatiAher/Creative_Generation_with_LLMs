Just like magma in volcanoes rise,
Buoyancy lifts it towards the skies.
In Iron Man's Arc Reactor core,
Buoyancy's force helps him soar.

Heat Transfer in magma chambers deep,
From mantle to crust, it does seep.
In Tony Stark's Arc Reactor bright,
Transfers energy to power his flight.

Material Transport in lava's flow,
Creates mountains where it goes.
In the Arc Reactor's energy spread,
Tony Stark moves, swift and led.
