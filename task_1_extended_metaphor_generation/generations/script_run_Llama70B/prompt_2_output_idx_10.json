  "purpose": "The Space Weather aims to understand and predict the impact of solar events on Earth's environment, including disruptions to satellite communications, power grids, and atmospheric conditions. This knowledge helps protect both human life and technological infrastructure from the adverse effects of solar activity.",
  "mechanism": "The Space Weather utilizes a combination of mathematical models, real-time monitoring of solar activity, and advanced computing systems to forecast space weather events. It integrates data from various sources, such as NASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO), and ground-based observatories. These data are processed using algorithms that analyze solar wind patterns, magnetic fields, and radiation levels. The resulting information is then used to generate alerts and advisories for industries, government agencies, and the general public, helping them take precautions against potential disruptions caused by space weather events."
