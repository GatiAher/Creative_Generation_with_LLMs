  "purpose": "Electrical Energy enables the efficient transfer of energy across distances, allowing for the powering of devices and systems that are critical to our daily lives. It plays a vital role in modern society by facilitating communication, transportation, lighting, heating, and cooling. This form of energy is also crucial in the functioning of various industrial processes and medical equipment.",
  "mechanism": "The Electrical Energy is based on the movement of charged particles, like electrons in a conductor. A conductor can be thought of as a pathway through which these charged particles can flow. By applying a potential difference, or voltage, between two points along this pathway, we create an electric field that propels the charged particles forward. This movement of charged particles can then be harnessed to perform useful work, such as turning a motor or generating light. The structure of the Electrical Energy is designed to optimize efficiency and reliability by minimizing energy loss during transmission and ensuring consistent delivery to meet varying demands."
