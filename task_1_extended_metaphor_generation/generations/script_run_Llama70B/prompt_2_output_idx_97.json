  "purpose": "The atmospheric temperature measures the thermal energy in the air, which affects the state of materials, evaporation rates, and heat transfer between the environment and objects within it. This information helps predict weather patterns, calculate thermal comfort for living organisms, and informs designs involving atmospheric conditions.",
  "mechanism": "The atmospheric temperature is a complex system where solar radiation, greenhouse gases, and atmospheric circulation patterns interact. Solar radiation heats the Earth's surface, which in turn warms the air through conduction. Greenhouse gases trap some of this heat by absorbing infrared radiation emitted by the Earth's surface and atmosphere, contributing to the overall temperature. Atmospheric circulation patterns distribute this heat around the globe, creating regional variations in temperature. This interplay of factors produces a dynamic, ever-changing temperature profile that is crucial for understanding and predicting environmental phenomena."
