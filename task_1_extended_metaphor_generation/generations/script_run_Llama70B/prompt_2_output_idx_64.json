  "purpose": "The Reaction Mechanism provides a detailed, step-by-step explanation of how a chemical reaction occurs, allowing chemists and engineers to understand the underlying bond-forming and bond-breaking processes involved. This understanding enables them to optimize reaction conditions, predict reaction outcomes, and design new reactions. In essence, it serves as a roadmap for the transformation of reactants into products.",
  "mechanism": "The Reaction Mechanism is structured as a series of discrete steps, each describing a specific bond-forming or bond-breaking process. This step-wise progression allows chemists and engineers to visualize and analyze the reaction pathway, identifying key intermediates, transition states, and rate-determining steps. The mechanism is often depicted using diagrams or illustrations that show the movement of electrons and atoms during each step, providing a spatial representation of the reaction. By following the sequence of steps outlined in the reaction mechanism, chemists can synthesize new compounds, modify existing ones, and develop more efficient and sustainable reaction routes."
