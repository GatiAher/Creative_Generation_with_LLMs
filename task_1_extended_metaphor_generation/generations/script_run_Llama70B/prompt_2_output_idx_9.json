  "purpose": "The Rings serve as a protective barrier that helps maintain the stability of the planet's atmosphere and surface conditions by regulating the influx of asteroids and comets. They also act as a natural filter, blocking harmful radiation and cosmic debris from entering the planet's atmosphere.",
  "mechanism": "The Rings are composed of thin, circular structures made of ice and rock particles that orbit around the planet. The particles are held together by gravitational forces and are constantly colliding with each other, creating a dense and stable ring system. This structure allows the Rings to absorb and deflect incoming asteroids and comets, preventing them from impacting the planet's surface. Additionally, the Rings act as a shield, protecting the planet from harmful radiation and cosmic debris by absorbing or deflecting them away from the planet."
