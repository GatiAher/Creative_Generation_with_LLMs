 Gravitational Lensing enables us to observe distant objects in the universe by exploiting the {gravitational force} of a massive object like a galaxy or black hole, which creates a kind of lens that magnifies and distorts light from far away, allowing us to study things that would otherwise be too small or faint to see. The {gravitational force} of the massive object warps space and time around it, creating a region where light travels more slowly than usual. When light from a distant source enters this region, it gets bent towards the center of the massive object due to the {curvature of space-time}, effectively acting as a lens. This bending effect can create multiple images of the same source, arcs, rings, or even magnify the appearance of distant galaxies, providing valuable information about their mass, distance, and composition.
