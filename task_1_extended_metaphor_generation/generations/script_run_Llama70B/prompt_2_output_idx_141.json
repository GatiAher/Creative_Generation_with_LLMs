  "purpose": "Nuclear Energy provides a concentrated and sustainable source of power for various applications, including electricity generation, medicine, and industrial processes. By harnessing the energy stored in atomic nuclei, it offers a cleaner and more efficient alternative to traditional fossil fuels, contributing to a reduced carbon footprint and environmental impact.",
  "mechanism": "The Nuclear Energy mechanism involves the manipulation of atomic nuclei to release or absorb energy. In fission reactions, atoms are split into smaller fragments, liberating excess energy. Conversely, in fusion reactions, atomic nuclei combine to form heavier elements, also releasing energy. These reactions occur within controlled environments, such as reactors or particle accelerators, where conditions like temperature, pressure, and radiation levels are carefully managed to ensure safe and efficient energy production."
