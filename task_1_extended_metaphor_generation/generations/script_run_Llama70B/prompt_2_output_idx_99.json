  "purpose": "Cools the earth by reflecting sunlight and regulating temperature",
  "mechanism": "Composed of water droplets or ice crystals suspended in the air, with a typical height of 10,000\u201318,000 meters. They form when water vapor in the air condenses onto tiny particles like dust, salt, and pollen, creating visible liquid or solid masses. The clouds' shape and density determine their ability to reflect sunlight and produce precipitation, which plays a crucial role in regulating Earth's climate and weather patterns."
