  "purpose": "The Isotopic composition provides a snapshot of the diversity of atoms within a sample, which is essential for understanding various physical and chemical properties of the material. By analyzing the proportions of different isotopes, scientists can identify patterns and relationships that offer insights into various phenomena such as Earth's history, climate change, and biological processes.",
  "mechanism": "The Isotopic composition is structured by categorizing isotopes based on their mass number, which is the sum of protons and neutrons in an atom's nucleus. This classification allows researchers to compare and contrast the abundance of various isotopes in a sample, leading to valuable information about the sample's origin, evolution, and interactions with its environment."
