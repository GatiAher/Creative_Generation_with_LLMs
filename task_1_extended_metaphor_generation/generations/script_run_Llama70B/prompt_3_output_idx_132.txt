 {{{"Isotope dating provides a means to measure the passage of time since a rock or mineral was formed, by observing the proportion of radioactive isotopes present. This allows scientists to reconstruct the history of geological events and processes that have shaped our planet. The technique involves analyzing the ratio of two or more isotopes in a sample, one of which is radioactive and decays at a known rate. By comparing the amount of the parent isotope remaining with the amount of daughter isotope produced through radioactive decay, scientists can calculate the age of the sample. The mechanism is based on the principles of radioactivity, half-lives, and exponential decay, which provide a mathematical framework for determining the age of a sample with high precision."}}}
