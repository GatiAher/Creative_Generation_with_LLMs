 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings:

{Computer Science}: The purpose of an Operating System is to act as a foundation for other software programs, providing them with access to the computer's hardware resources while also protecting the system from potential threats. It's similar to a city's infrastructure, which manages traffic, public services, and security, allowing citizens to live and work comfortably. The Operating System acts as a mediator between computer hardware and user applications.

{Chemistry}: It divides the computer's resources into smaller, manageable parts called processes, allowing multiple programs to run simultaneously without interfering with each other.

{Geometry}: The OS also provides a layer of abstraction between the user's commands and the computer's hardware, making it easier for developers to create programs without worrying about the underlying hardware details.

{Engineering}: Additionally, the OS handles input/output operations, memory management, file systems, and security protocols, ensuring a smooth interaction between the user and the computer.
