  "purpose": "The Momentum represents the quantity of motion associated with an object, which determines its tendency to keep moving or resist changes in its motion. It plays a crucial role in various disciplines such as engineering, design, and mathematics, where understanding and managing motion is essential.",
  "mechanism": "The Momentum is calculated by multiplying an object's mass and velocity. This combination of properties allows for calculations of force, acceleration, and other key parameters that describe an object's motion. In turn, this information can be used to predict and control motion in diverse contexts, from robotics and machine design to vehicle dynamics and collision analysis."
