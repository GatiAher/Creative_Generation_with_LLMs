  "purpose": "Regulating blood sugar levels by adjusting cellular glucose uptake to maintain homeostasis",
  "mechanism": "Insulin resistance is a negative feedback loop whereby decreased cellular sensitivity to insulin leads to increased glucose concentration, signaling for reduced insulin production and increased glucagon secretion to restore balance."
