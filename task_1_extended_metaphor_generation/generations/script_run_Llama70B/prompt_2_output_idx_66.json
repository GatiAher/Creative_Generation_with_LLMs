  "purpose": "Catalysts accelerate chemical reactions, allowing them to happen faster and more efficiently, similar to how a well-designed machine part enables a smoother and more productive assembly line.",
  "mechanism": "Catalysts are designed with a specific geometry and structure that allows them to interact with reactant molecules in a way that lowers the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. By reducing the energy barrier, the catalyst enables the reaction to proceed at a faster rate and with greater efficiency, much like a well-engineered gear system enables a machine to operate more smoothly."
