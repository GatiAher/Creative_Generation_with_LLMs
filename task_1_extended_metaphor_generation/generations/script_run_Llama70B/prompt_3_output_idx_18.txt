"The Event Horizon acts as a boundary beyond which the gravitational pull of a black hole becomes so strong that any object or radiation that crosses it will be trapped by the black hole, unable to escape. This boundary serves as a point of no return, marking the point where the gravitational force becomes so powerful that it warps spacetime, creating a region from which nothing can exit. The Event Horizon is formed by the curvature of spacetime caused by the massive gravity of a black hole. As matter falls into a black hole, its gravity grows stronger, causing spacetime to bend and twist around it. The Event Horizon forms at the point where this curvature becomes so extreme that it creates a closed surface, effectively cutting off anything inside from the rest of the universe. Once something crosses the Event Horizon, it is pulled inexorably towards the singularity at the center of the black hole, unable to escape due to the immense gravitational force."
