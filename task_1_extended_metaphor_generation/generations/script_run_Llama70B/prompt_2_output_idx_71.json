  "purpose": "Data Structures provide a way to organize and manage large amounts of data in a way that makes it easy to access, modify, and analyze. They are like blueprints for building efficient data storage systems that can be used in various applications such as games, social media platforms, or financial software.",
  "mechanism": "Data Structures are designed based on mathematical concepts such as graphs, trees, and matrices. These structures allow for efficient search, insertion, deletion, and manipulation of data. For example, a binary tree allows for fast searching by dividing the data into smaller subsets until the desired element is found. A graph can represent relationships between data points, allowing for efficient routing and network analysis. The specific structure used depends on the type of problem being solved and the requirements of the application."
