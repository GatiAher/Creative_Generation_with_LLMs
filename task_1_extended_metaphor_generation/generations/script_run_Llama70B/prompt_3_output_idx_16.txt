Dark Energy serves as a driving force behind the accelerating expansion of the universe, allowing it to continue expanding indefinitely and shaping the large-scale structure of the cosmos. Dark Energy operates through modifying the fabric of spacetime itself, permeating all corners of existence with an ever-present pressure that pushes matter apart at an increasing rate, causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate over time.
