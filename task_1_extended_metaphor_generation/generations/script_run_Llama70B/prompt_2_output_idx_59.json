  "purpose": "The Solubility fulfills the purpose of facilitating the interaction between two substances by allowing them to mix and combine evenly. This enables various processes such as chemical reactions, cleaning, and purification, which are essential in fields like engineering, manufacturing, and environmental protection.",
  "mechanism": "The Solubility is structured around the concept of intermolecular forces, which govern the interactions between molecules. The strength and nature of these forces determine whether a substance can dissolve in another substance. By understanding and manipulating these forces, engineers and scientists can design and optimize solutions that take advantage of solubility, such as drug delivery systems, detergents, and catalysts."
