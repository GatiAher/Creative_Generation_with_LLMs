"The Cinder cone's purpose is to provide a stable and efficient means of dispersing ash and gas buildup resulting from volcanic activity, thereby regulating pressure and preventing more explosive eruptions. The Cinder cone's mechanism involves its conical shape, which allows for the gradual accumulation of ash and cinder around a central vent. This shape also enables the formation of a chimney-like structure that channels gases and ash upward, promoting their release into the atmosphere while minimizing the risk of larger eruptions."
