 {{{Theoretical yield}}}{ Ideal benchmark}{chemical reaction}. By calculating the maximum possible yield based on the available reactants, it allows us to compare actual yields with the potential maxima, thereby identifying areas for process optimization. {Theoretical yield} is rooted in the principle of conservation of mass, which dictates that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. By analyzing the stoichiometry of a chemical reaction's balanced equation, we can determine the limiting reagent and calculate the maximum quantity of product that can be produced. This calculation relies on the concept of {mole ratios}{ Chemistry }and the laws of definite and multiple proportions, which enable us to predict the outcome of a reaction given the starting materials and their quantities.
