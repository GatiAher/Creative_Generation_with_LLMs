 {{double curly braces}}"The atmospheric circulation regulates Earth's climate by distributing heat and moisture around the globe, influencing weather patterns, and maintaining a stable environment for life on our planet. The atmospheric circulation consists of various cells and jet streams that form due to unequal heating across the Earth's surface. This creates pressure gradients that drive the movement of air masses, which in turn, influence temperature, humidity, and precipitation patterns. Additionally, the rotation of the Earth and Coriolis force deflect moving air masses, creating large-scale circulation patterns such as trade winds, westerlies, and easterlies. These circulation patterns help distribute energy and moisture from equatorial regions towards the poles, moderating local climates and maintaining global climate stability."{{/double curly braces}}
