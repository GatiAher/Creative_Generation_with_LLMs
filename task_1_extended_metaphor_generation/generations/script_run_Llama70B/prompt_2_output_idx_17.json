  "purpose": "The Black Hole's purpose is to create a boundary in spacetime where matter and energy are severely distorted, causing an irreversible collapse. This collapse creates a point of infinite density and zero volume, known as a singularity, where the laws of physics break down. The Black Hole's gravity is so strong that it warps spacetime around it, creating a region from which nothing, including light, can escape.",
  "mechanism": "The Black Hole's mechanism is based on its extreme mass and spin. The immense gravitational force causes spacetime to curve inward, creating a vortex-like effect that traps everything that gets too close. The event horizon, the point of no return, marks the boundary beyond which anything that enters cannot escape. The ergosphere, a region outside the event horizon, is where the rotation of the Black Hole creates a kind of 'gravitational drag' that can extract energy from objects that enter it. The singularity at the center of the Black Hole is the point where the curvature of spacetime is infinite and the laws of physics cease to apply."
