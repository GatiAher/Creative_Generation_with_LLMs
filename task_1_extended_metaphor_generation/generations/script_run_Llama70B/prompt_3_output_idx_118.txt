 Here is the annotated text with the requested surroundings:

"The Stratovolcano's purpose is to provide a stable and efficient means of transporting {magma} and {ash} from beneath the Earth's surface upwards, allowing for periodic and controlled releases of pressure and heat through its unique shape and structure. The Stratovolcano's mechanism consists of a series of alternating layers of {lava}, {tephra}, and other pyroclastic material that are deposited over time. The layers form a cone-like shape that tapers towards the top, allowing for a buildup of pressure and heat inside the volcano. This pressure and heat is then released through occasional eruptions, which help maintain the stability of the surrounding region by preventing the buildup of excessive pressure. The Stratovolcano's design also allows for the formation of a {magma chamber}, which stores and mixes magma before it is released through an eruption."
