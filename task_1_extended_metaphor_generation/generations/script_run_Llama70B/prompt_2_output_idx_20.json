  "purpose": "The purpose of Frame Dragging is to illustrate the concept of curvature of spacetime caused by massive objects. It visualizes the dragging of spacetime fabric around a rotating body, which helps us understand the fundamental principles of general relativity.",
  "mechanism": "Frame Dragging works by applying the equation of geodesic deviation to a rotating body. This creates a region around the body where spacetime is curved and distorted, causing nearby objects to move along with its rotation. The effect becomes more pronounced near the event horizon of a black hole, where the gravitational pull is strongest."
