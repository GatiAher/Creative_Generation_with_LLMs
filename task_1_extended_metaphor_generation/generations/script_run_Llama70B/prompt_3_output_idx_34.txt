 Here is the annotated text with the requested surroundings for biology, chemistry, scientific jargon, geometry, math, engineering, and design-related words, phrases, and adjectives:

"The {Keystone species} plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and integrity of its {ecosystem}, much like a {keystone} holds up an {archway}. By exerting a disproportionate influence on its environment relative to its abundance, the Keystone species helps create and sustain a balanced and functional ecological system. The Keystone species' unique {characteristics} and behaviors enable it to act as a {linchpin} within its ecosystem. Its {structural elements} - such as physical adaptations or social organization - allow it to modulate the interactions between other species and their environment, creating a harmonious network of relationships that support {biodiversity} and {resilience}."

Double curly braces enclose terms related to biology, chemistry, or scientific jargon, such as "Keystone species," "ecosystem," "adaptations," and "resilience."

Square brackets enclose terms related to geometry, mathematics, engineering, and design, such as "keystone," "archway," and "structural elements".
