  "purpose": "The Equilibrium Constants provide a mathematical framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of chemical reactions. They allow researchers to study the thermodynamic properties of a system and determine the conditions under which a reaction will occur.",
  "mechanism": "The Equilibrium Constants are based on the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium, where the rates of forward and reverse reactions are equal. By analyzing the concentrations of reactants and products at equilibrium, researchers can calculate the equilibrium constant, K, which describes the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations. The value of K determines the direction of the reaction and can be used to predict the outcome of changes in temperature, pressure, or concentration. In this way, the Equilibrium Constants provide a powerful tool for optimizing and controlling chemical reactions."
