  "purpose": "Ecosystem services provide a range of essential benefits to humans and other organisms, including air and water purification, soil formation, and climate regulation. These services are critical for maintaining public health, supporting economic development, and ensuring environmental sustainability.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism behind ecosystem services involves complex interactions between biotic and abiotic components within an ecosystem. The structure of an ecosystem is organized around the flow of energy and nutrients, which supports the growth and diversity of life forms. This structure enables the provision of various ecosystem services, such as pollination, pest control, and nutrient cycling, that support human well-being and the health of other species."
