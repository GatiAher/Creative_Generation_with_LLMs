  "purpose": "The mole concept provides a way to express the amount of a substance in a way that is easy to work with and understand, similar to how a dozen or a liter are used to represent quantities of everyday objects. It allows for simple and consistent measurements and calculations of amounts of substances, making it easier to study and predict the behavior of materials and their interactions.",
  "mechanism": "The mole concept is based on the idea that each substance has a unique number of particles, called Avogadro's number, which can be used as a conversion factor between different units of measurement. This means that no matter the size or shape of a sample of a substance, it can be represented by a single unit, the mole, which makes calculations and comparisons simpler and more accurate. Additionally, the mole concept enables scientists to easily calculate amounts of substances needed for reactions, allowing them to better control and predict outcomes."
