"The Mechanical Energy {{{physics}}}{{energy}} provides a measure of the total energy possessed by a physical system, which can be used to predict its behavior and performance. By combining both kinetic energy, {{{physics}}}{{energy}} which represents the energy of motion, and potential energy, {{{physics}}}{{energy}} which represents the energy stored in the system due to its position or configuration, it allows for a more comprehensive understanding of the system's dynamics and how it will respond to external forces or changes in its environment. The Mechanical Energy is calculated as the sum of kinetic energy and potential energy. This combination allows for a complete accounting of the system's energy and enables engineers to analyze and predict its behavior under various conditions. For example, when designing a machine, the Mechanical Energy can help determine the amount of work that can be performed by the machine and how efficiently it will convert input energy into useful work. {{{engineering}}}{{design}}}
