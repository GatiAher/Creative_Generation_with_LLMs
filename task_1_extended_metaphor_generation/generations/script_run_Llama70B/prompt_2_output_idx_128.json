  "purpose": "The Isotopic abundance provides a way to quantify the relative amount of a specific isotope present in a sample, allowing for the identification and analysis of the sample's composition and origin. This information can be used in various fields such as chemistry, biology, and environmental science to understand the behavior and interactions of elements and their isotopes.",
  "mechanism": "The Isotopic abundance is structured by comparing the ratio of a particular isotope to its naturally occurring stable isotopes. This ratio is then compared to known standards or reference materials to determine the abundance of the isotope in the sample. The structure is supported by mathematical equations and algorithms that take into account the decay rates of unstable isotopes and the natural abundance of stable isotopes, ensuring accurate and precise measurements."
