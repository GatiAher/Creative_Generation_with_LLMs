  "purpose": "Dark Matter provides a foundation for visible matter to exist upon, much like a building's foundation supports the weight of the structure above ground. It is a necessary component for the stability and integrity of the universe, allowing galaxies and galaxy clusters to maintain their shape and resist the forces that would otherwise cause them to collapse or fly apart.",
  "mechanism": "Dark Matter is thought to be composed of exotic particles that do not interact with light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, making them invisible to our telescopes. These particles are spread throughout the universe, creating a web-like network that permeates all of space. The gravity of this network pulls visible matter into place, providing the mass necessary to anchor galaxies and galaxy clusters in existence. Through its gravitational influence, Dark Matter also plays a key role in the formation of stars and planets, guiding the accretion of gas and dust into dense regions where they can eventually ignite and shine."
