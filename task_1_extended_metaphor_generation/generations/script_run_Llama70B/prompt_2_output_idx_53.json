  "purpose": "Theoretical yield serves as an ideal benchmark for assessing the efficiency of a chemical reaction. By calculating the maximum possible yield based on the available reactants, it allows us to compare actual yields with the potential maxima, thereby identifying areas for process optimization.",
  "mechanism": "Theoretical yield is rooted in the principle of conservation of mass, which dictates that matter cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. By analyzing the stoichiometry of a chemical reaction's balanced equation, we can determine the limiting reagent and calculate the maximum quantity of product that can be produced. This calculation relies on the concept of mole ratios and the laws of definite and multiple proportions, which enable us to predict the outcome of a reaction given the starting materials and their quantities."
