  "purpose": "The atmospheric circulation regulates Earth's climate by distributing heat and moisture around the globe. It plays a crucial role in maintaining a stable climate and weather pattern, which is essential for sustaining life on Earth.",
  "mechanism": "The atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in temperature and pressure across the planet. Warm air rises, creating convection currents that drive winds and ocean currents. These circulation patterns distribute heat and moisture from the equator towards the poles, influencing weather patterns and climate zones. The rotation of the Earth also contributes to the formation of large-scale vortices like the polar vortex, which further influence regional climates."
