 Here is the annotated text with the requested surroundings:

"The activation energy serves as a threshold for chemical reactions to take place. It acts as a gatekeeper, ensuring that only molecules with sufficient energy can overcome the barrier and participate in the reaction. This filter-like function allows for the selection of specific reactants and products, enabling the control of chemical outcomes. The activation energy is a geometric construct {{{chemistry}}} representing the highest point on a potential energy surface separating the reactants from the products. It is the maximum energy required for the transition state, which is the intermediate stage between the reactants and products. By setting this energy barrier, the system ensures that only molecules with enough kinetic energy can overcome the obstacle and reach the transition state. In essence, the activation energy functions like a key that fits into a lock, allowing the right molecules to bind and react while rejecting all others."

The words surrounded by double curly braces are "activation energy", "potential energy surface", "transition state", "reactants", "products", and "kinetic energy". These terms are related to chemistry or scientific jargon.

The words surrounded by square braces are "geometric construct" and "intermediate stage". These terms relate to geometry, math, engineering, and design.
