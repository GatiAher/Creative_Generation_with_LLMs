  "purpose": "The purpose of Peer-to-Peer Networking is to enable direct communication between equals, eliminating intermediaries, allowing for efficient and resilient exchange of data, resources, or services, much like how a triangle's three vertices are connected by sides of equal length, forming a strong and stable structure.",
  "mechanism": "In this distributed computing model, nodes or peers function as both clients and servers, interconnected in a mesh-like fashion, similar to how a mesh's vertices and edges form a network of interconnected triangles. Each node maintains a list of neighboring nodes, and communication occurs directly between them, ensuring that information or resources are efficiently exchanged and improving overall system reliability and scalability, much like how a mesh's interconnected nature provides strength and flexibility."
