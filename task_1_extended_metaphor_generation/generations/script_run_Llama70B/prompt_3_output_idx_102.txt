 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings:

"The Scale provides a mathematical representation of the relationships between distances on a two-dimensional surface, allowing for accurate measurements and comparisons to be made between points and distances in a way that is not possible by relying solely on visual observations. The Scale utilizes a system of units and ratios to establish a consistent relationship between distances on a map and their real-world counterparts. This is achieved through the use of {{{chemistry}}} cartesian coordinates, which enable the mapping of points and distances onto a grid system, facilitating calculations and comparisons across different locations and distances."

Words surrounded by double curly braces are "chemistry" and "cartesian coordinates".

Words surrounded by square braces are none.
