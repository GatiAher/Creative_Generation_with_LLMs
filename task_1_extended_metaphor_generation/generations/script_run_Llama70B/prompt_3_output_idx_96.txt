 {{ }} Atmospheric pressure is a force that acts on objects within the atmosphere, due to the weight of the air above them. This pressure helps maintain the shape of the Earth's atmosphere, allowing it to contain gases essential for life on our planet. The atmospheric pressure is structured as a force that increases with depth, resulting from the weight of the overlying air molecules. This pressure gradient drives the movement of air masses and their associated weather patterns, while also providing an ideal environment for aerodynamic flight. Additionally, atmospheric pressure plays a crucial role in determining the temperature profile of the atmosphere, influencing the formation of clouds and precipitation.
