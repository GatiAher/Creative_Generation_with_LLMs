  "purpose": "The Mass provides stability and inertia to an object, allowing it to maintain its velocity and resist external forces that might otherwise cause it to accelerate or decelerate. This property is useful in various applications such as construction, transportation, and robotics, where objects need to maintain their position and momentum over time.",
  "mechanism": "The Mass is composed of a large amount of dense material, such as steel or concrete, which provides a high level of resistance to deformation and movement. This density and volume of material creates a stable foundation that can absorb and distribute external forces, preventing the object from moving or changing its trajectory suddenly. In addition, the Mass can be designed with a specific shape and structure to optimize its performance for a particular application, such as a flywheel or a counterweight."
