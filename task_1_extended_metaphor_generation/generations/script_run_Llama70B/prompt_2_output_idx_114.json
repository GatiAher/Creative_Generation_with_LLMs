  "purpose": "ENSO regulates Earth's temperature by transferring heat from the tropics to the poles, modulating the planet's energy balance and influencing global weather patterns, thereby maintaining a stable global climate.",
  "mechanism": "ENSO is a complex system involving oceanic and atmospheric processes. It is characterized by fluctuations in the surface pressure difference between the eastern and western Pacific Ocean, which in turn affects the trade winds and the equatorial Pacific thermocline. During an El Ni\u00f1o event, the thermocline shifts eastward, releasing warm water into the atmosphere and redistributing heat around the globe. Conversely, during a La Ni\u00f1a event, the thermocline shifts westward, absorbing heat from the atmosphere and cooling the planet. This process influences the polar vortex, modifying its strength and position, ultimately impacting local weather patterns."
