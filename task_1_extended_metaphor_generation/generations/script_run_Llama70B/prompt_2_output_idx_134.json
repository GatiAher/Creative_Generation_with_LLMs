  "purpose": "Isotope biogeochemistry provides a framework for understanding the movement and transformation of elements and their isotopes within the Earth's systems, allowing us to better comprehend the complex interactions between the planet's geological, atmospheric, and hydrological processes. By studying these cycles, we can gain valuable insights into Earth's history, climate change, and the impact of human activities on the environment.",
  "mechanism": "The Isotope biogeochemistry is structured around the principles of nuclear physics and chemical reactions, which govern the behavior of isotopes in various environments. This allows researchers to trace the pathways of elemental cycling and transformations through different reservoirs and fluxes, such as atmospheric circulation, ocean currents, soil formation, and organism metabolism. By analyzing the isotopic composition of samples from diverse sources, scientists can decipher the underlying mechanisms that drive Earth's biogeochemical cycles and evaluate the effects of natural and anthropogenic factors on these processes."
