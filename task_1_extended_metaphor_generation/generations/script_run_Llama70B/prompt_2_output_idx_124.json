  "purpose": "Plate Boundaries are critical for regulating the movement of tectonic plates, ensuring their smooth and continuous motion, and maintaining the balance of the Earth's crust. They act as boundaries or interfaces between adjacent plates, allowing them to interact and transfer energy, mass, and momentum. This helps maintain the Earth's geological stability and influences the formation of landscapes, oceans, and natural resources.",
  "mechanism": "The Plate Boundaries are characterized by different types of interactions between neighboring plates, such as convergent, divergent, and transform boundaries. Convergent boundaries are zones of compression, where two plates move towards each other, often resulting in subduction, collision, or mountain building. Divergent boundaries are zones of extension, where two plates move away from each other, leading to the creation of new oceanic crust, mid-ocean ridges, and rift valleys. Transform boundaries are areas where two plates slide past each other horizontally, facilitating the transfer of energy and momentum between the plates. The structure of the Plate Boundaries involves the lithosphere, asthenosphere, and mantle, which work together to accommodate plate movement and interaction. The lithosphere is the rigid outer layer of the Earth, broken into several large plates that float on the more fluid asthenosphere below. The mantle is a thick layer of hot, viscous rock beneath the asthenosphere, which provides the driving force for plate motion through convection currents."
