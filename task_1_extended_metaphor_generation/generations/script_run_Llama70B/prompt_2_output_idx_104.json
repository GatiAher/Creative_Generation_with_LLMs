  "purpose": "The Contour line serves as a visual representation of constant elevation on a terrain, allowing for easy identification of patterns and features in the landscape, such as valleys, ridges, and plateaus. It helps in understanding the shape and slope of the terrain, which is crucial information in various fields like engineering, architecture, and environmental studies.",
  "mechanism": "The Contour line is created by connecting points of equal elevation on a terrain through imaginary lines. These lines are spaced at regular intervals, usually in meters or feet, to provide a detailed representation of the terrain's shape and slope. The distance between each contour line represents a consistent change in elevation, enabling users to infer the steepness and direction of slopes. Additionally, contour lines can be used to identify prominent features like mountains, valleys, and rivers, as well as to determine the orientation of slopes and the direction of water flow."
