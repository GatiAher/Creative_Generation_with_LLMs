  "purpose": "The Cinder cone's purpose is to provide a stable and efficient means of dispersing ash and gas buildup resulting from volcanic activity, thereby regulating pressure and preventing more explosive eruptions.",
  "mechanism": "The Cinder cone's mechanism involves its conical shape, which allows for the gradual accumulation of ash and cinder around a central vent. This shape also enables the formation of a chimney-like structure that channels gases and ash upward, promoting their release into the atmosphere while minimizing the risk of larger eruptions."
