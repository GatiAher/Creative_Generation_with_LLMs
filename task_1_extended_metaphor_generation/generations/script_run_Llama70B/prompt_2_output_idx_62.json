  "purpose": "Stoichiometry provides a framework for understanding the proportional relationships between reactants and products in chemical reactions. By analyzing these relationships, researchers can better understand the underlying chemistry and predict the outcomes of reactions. This information is crucial in fields such as materials science, pharmaceuticals, and environmental remediation, where the precise control of chemical reactions is essential.",
  "mechanism": "The stoichiometry of a reaction is typically expressed as a set of coefficients or fractions that represent the relative amounts of reactants required to produce a certain amount of product. These coefficients are derived from the molecular structures of the reactants and products, and are based on the principles of conservation of mass and atomic efficiency. By examining the stoichiometry of a reaction, researchers can determine the limiting reactant, the theoretical yield of product, and the extent of the reaction. Additionally, stoichiometry can be used to identify potential side reactions and optimize reaction conditions to achieve the desired outcome."
