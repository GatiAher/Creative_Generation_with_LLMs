  "purpose": "The purpose of API Design is to create a blueprint for developers to follow when building APIs. It provides a clear and consistent set of rules and guidelines that ensure the API is easy to use, understand, and maintain. This blueprint helps to avoid confusion and mistakes, making it easier for developers to work together on the same codebase. In essence, API Design is like creating a detailed plan for a building; it outlines the layout, structure, and functionality of the building, allowing architects, engineers, and builders to work together effectively and bring the building to life.",
  "mechanism": "API Design is structured using a combination of documentation, examples, and constraints. The documentation provides a detailed description of each endpoint, method, and data format used in the API. Examples are provided to illustrate how the API should be used, and constraints are put in place to ensure that the API is used correctly and consistently. These components work together to create a cohesive and robust framework that supports the development of high-quality APIs. In a way, it's like engineering a bridge; the design must take into account various factors such as weight, stress, and durability, and provide a clear blueprint for construction, ensuring that the final product meets all requirements and is safe and reliable."
