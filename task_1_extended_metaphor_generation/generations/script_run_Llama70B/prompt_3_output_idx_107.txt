 Here is the annotated text, with double curly braces around geography, chemistry, and scientific jargon, and square braces around geometry, math, engineering, and design:

"The purpose of {{{map symbols}}} is to provide a visual representation of various features and objects on a map, allowing users to quickly and easily identify important information. They serve as a graphical shorthand for complex data, making it easier for viewers to understand and analyze the information being presented. Map symbols are typically represented as simple geometric shapes or icons, each with a unique meaning and context. These symbols are arranged and organized on the map using a system of {{{coordinates}}}, allowing them to be accurately positioned and aligned with real-world locations. The use of standardized symbol sets and colors enables clear communication of information across different maps and users, while also providing visual consistency and clarity."
