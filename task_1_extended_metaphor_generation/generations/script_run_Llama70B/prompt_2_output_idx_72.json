  "purpose": "Software Engineering applies engineering principles and techniques to ensure software systems are reliable, efficient, and maintainable. It bridges the gap between computer science and bridge-building by creating a systematic approach to software development, focusing on quality, reliability, and safety. Just as a building's foundation must be designed to support its weight, Software Engineering ensures that software can support its intended function and user needs.",
  "mechanism": "Software Engineering is structured around a set of processes and methodologies that guide the development, testing, and maintenance of software systems. These processes include requirements gathering, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Each process has defined inputs and outputs, and they are integrated into a cohesive workflow that ensures quality and consistency across the entire software lifecycle. By breaking down the software development process into manageable parts, Software Engineering enables teams to collaborate effectively, identify potential issues early, and deliver high-quality software products."
