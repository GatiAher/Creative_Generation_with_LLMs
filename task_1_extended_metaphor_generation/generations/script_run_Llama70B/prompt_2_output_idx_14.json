  "purpose": "The Galaxy Evolution provides a framework for understanding the development and transformation of galaxies over time, allowing us to study the evolution of celestial structures in a holistic manner. By examining the changes that occur within galaxies and between them, we can gain insights into the underlying physical processes that govern the behavior of matter and energy on a cosmic scale.",
  "mechanism": "The Galaxy Evolution is structured around the concept of hierarchical clustering, where smaller galaxies merge to form larger ones. This process is driven by gravitational attraction and the collapse of gas and dust. As galaxies interact with each other, they exchange matter and energy through various means such as ram pressure stripping, tidal forces, and galaxy mergers. These interactions shape the morphology and composition of galaxies, leading to diverse galaxy populations across the universe. Engineering principles come into play when analyzing the stability and dynamics of galaxy clusters and the design of telescopes and observation methods used to study these phenomena."
