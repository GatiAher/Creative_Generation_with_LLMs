 {{{stable isotopes}}}, {{{composition}}}, {{geological}}{{environmental}}{{processes}}}. By analyzing the consistency of stable isotopes, scientists can identify patterns and trends that would otherwise be obscured by natural variations in the sample. The stability of isotopes is based on their atomic mass, which determines their physical and chemical properties. The number of neutrons in an atom's nucleus affects its mass, and thus the behavior of atoms in chemical reactions. Stable isotopes have a consistent number of neutrons that maintains their mass and molecular structure, making them unchanging references for comparison. Scientists use this property to establish ratios between different isotopes in a sample, which remain constant over time unless influenced by external factors. This allows researchers to detect deviations from these constant ratios, signaling changes in the sample's history or conditions."""
