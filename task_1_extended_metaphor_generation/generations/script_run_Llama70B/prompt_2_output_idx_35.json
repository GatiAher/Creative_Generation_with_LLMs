  "purpose": "Nucleotides serve as the fundamental units of genomic information storage and transmission. They facilitate the encoding, transcription, and translation of genetic instructions for protein synthesis, which underpins the growth, development, and function of living organisms.",
  "mechanism": "The nucleotide's structure consists of a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases - adenine, thymine, guanine, or cytosine. This composition allows for the formation of complementary base pairs between nucleotides, creating a stable double helix structure when aligned antiparallel. The sequence of nucleotides determines the encoded genetic information, which can be replicated, transcribed, and translated into proteins through enzymatic processes. The specific base pairing and hydrogen bonding between complementary nucleotides ensures accuracy and fidelity in genetic information transfer."
