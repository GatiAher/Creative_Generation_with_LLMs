  "purpose": "Reaction Rates quantify the speed of chemical reactions, allowing researchers to understand and optimize these processes. This knowledge can be used to improve efficiency, yield, and safety in various applications, such as manufacturing, environmental remediation, and medicinal development.",
  "mechanism": "The Reaction Rates are influenced by factors such as concentration, temperature, and surface area, which are manipulated through geometric, mathematical, and engineering principles. By understanding the relationships between these factors and reaction rates, researchers can design optimal conditions for a given reaction, maximizing its efficiency and minimizing unwanted byproducts or side effects."
