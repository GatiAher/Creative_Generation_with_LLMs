 {{{"The Ecological niche serves as a spatial accommodator, facilitating coexistence among diverse species by allocating resources and habitats. It ensures efficient utilization of available space, minimizing conflicts over resources and promoting biodiversity. The Ecological niche operates through interdependent relationships between species, dividing the environment into functional subspaces. Each species has a unique set of requirements for survival, such as food sources, shelter, and breeding grounds. By mapping these needs onto geometric patterns, the niche carves out distinct regions in the landscape, creating zones tailored to individual species. This partitioning enables multiple species to coexist within a shared environment, fostering diversity and resilience in the ecosystem."}}}
