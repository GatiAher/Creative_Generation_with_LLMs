  "purpose": "The Redshift's purpose is to provide a visual representation of the rate at which the universe is expanding. It helps us understand the scale and pace of this expansion, allowing us to better comprehend the vastness and complexity of the cosmos.",
  "mechanism": "The Redshift works by measuring the change in wavelength of light as it travels through space over long distances. This change in wavelength is caused by the stretching of space itself as the universe expands. By analyzing the degree of this shift, scientists can infer how quickly the galaxy emitting the light is moving away from us, and thus how rapidly the universe is expanding. The Redshift's mechanism is based on the principles of wave propagation and the properties of spacetime, which allow it to accurately convey the effects of cosmic expansion."
