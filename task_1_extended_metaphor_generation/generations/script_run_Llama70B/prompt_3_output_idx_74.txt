"The purpose of {Computer Architecture} is to provide a framework for organizing and managing the various hardware components of a computer system. This framework allows for efficient communication between different parts of the system, enabling the computer to perform complex tasks and operations. In essence, it acts as a blueprint for the computer, ensuring that all components work together seamlessly to achieve the desired outputs. The mechanism of {Computer Architecture} involves dividing the system into smaller, manageable units called modules or components. Each module has a specific function, such as {processing data}, {storing information}, or {interacting with users}. These modules are connected through {buses} or {interfaces}, which allow them to communicate and exchange data. The architecture also includes the {instruction set}, which defines the rules and protocols for executing instructions and manipulating data. Additionally, it includes the {memory hierarchy}, which consists of different levels of {cache}, {main memory}, and {secondary storage devices}. All these components work together to enable the computer to process information, execute instructions, and produce output."
