  "purpose": "The Human-Computer Interaction aims to bridge the gap between humans and machines by creating user interfaces that are intuitive, user-friendly, and accessible to a wide range of users. By understanding how people interact with technology, HCI seeks to design systems that are efficient, effective, and enjoyable for people to use.",
  "mechanism": "HCI is structured around three main components: input, processing, and output. Input refers to the ways in which users can interact with a system, such as through keyboard strokes or mouse clicks. Processing refers to the actions taken by the system in response to user input, such as executing commands or retrieving data. Output refers to the visual representations or feedback provided to the user, such as text on a screen or sound from speakers. These components work together to create a seamless interaction experience for the user."
