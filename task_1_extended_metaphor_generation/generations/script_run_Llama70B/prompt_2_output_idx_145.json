  "purpose": "The Force serves to modify the motion of objects, specifically by increasing or decreasing their speed and/or direction. This allows for manipulation of movement, which is crucial in various disciplines such as engineering, design, and transportation.",
  "mechanism": "The Force operates through a transfer of energy from one object to another. When a force is applied to an object, it can cause the object's velocity to change, either by increasing its magnitude or altering its direction. The strength and direction of the force determine the resulting acceleration of the object. In this way, the Force provides a means to control and manipulate the motion of objects, making it an essential concept in many fields."
