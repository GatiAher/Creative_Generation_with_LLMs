  "purpose": "The Thyroid hormone regulation is responsible for maintaining optimal levels of T3 and T4 in the bloodstream, ensuring proper metabolic function, growth, and development. It acts as a control system, constantly monitoring and adjusting hormone levels to meet the body's needs.",
  "mechanism": "The regulation mechanism consists of several interconnected components. The thyroid gland produces T3 and T4, which are then transported through the bloodstream to reach their target cells. Feedback mechanisms monitor T3 and T4 levels, comparing them to setpoint values. Disparities between actual and desired levels trigger corrective actions via negative feedback loops. This self-regulating process operates like a well-designed thermostat, maintaining homeostasis in the body's metabolic processes."
