  "purpose": "The DNA structure serves as a stable and efficient storage medium for genetic information, allowing for the accurate transmission of inheritable traits from one generation to the next.",
  "mechanism": "The double helix structure of DNA consists of two complementary strands of nucleotides that are twisted together. This structure allows for the encoding of genetic information through the pairing of nitrogenous bases on opposing strands, with adenine pairing with thymine and guanine pairing with cytosine. The hydrogen bonding between these base pairs creates a stable molecule that can be easily replicated and transcribed by enzymes. Additionally, the double helix structure allows for the coiling of the long DNA molecule into compact chromatin fibers, making it easier to pack and organize within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells."
