 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings:

{Load balancing} {ensures} {no single server} {is overwhelmed} {with requests}, {which helps maintain} {response times}, {reduce latency}, {and avoid crashes}. {It's like a traffic manager} {for your infrastructure}, {directing cars (requests)} {to different routes (servers)} {to prevent congestion} {and optimize travel time}. {Load balancing} {works by dispersing} {incoming requests} {across multiple servers}, {similar to how a bridge distributes weight} {across multiple support beams}. {This distribution} {ensures that no single point} {is overstressed}, {increasing overall stability} {and resilience}. {The load balancer} {acts as a smart router}, {analyzing incoming requests} {and redirecting them} {to the best available server} {based on factors} {such as server capacity}, {location}, {and availability}. {By spreading the workload evenly}, {load balancing} {enables greater scalability}, {redundancy}, {and fault tolerance} {in distributed systems}.
