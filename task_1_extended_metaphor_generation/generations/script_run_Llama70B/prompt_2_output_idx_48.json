  "purpose": "Stoichiometry provides a mathematical framework for understanding the quantitative relationships between reactants and products in a chemical reaction. By analyzing these relationships, researchers and engineers can better understand the underlying mechanics of the reaction and optimize its efficiency, yield, and selectivity.",
  "mechanism": "The structure of stoichiometry is based on the concept of molecular ratios, which are derived from the chemical equation representing the reaction. This equation is used to describe the conversion of reactants into products, and the stoichiometric coefficients represent the ratio of moles of each substance involved in the reaction. The coefficients are then used to calculate the amount of reactants required to produce a desired amount of product, or vice versa. This approach allows researchers and engineers to design and optimize chemical reactions in a more efficient and cost-effective manner."
