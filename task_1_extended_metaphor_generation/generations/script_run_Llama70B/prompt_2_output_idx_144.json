  "purpose": "The acceleration of an object is responsible for altering its speed over a given period of time, allowing it to move more quickly or slowly as needed. This is crucial for a wide range of activities, from navigating tight spaces to achieving optimal speeds for efficient transportation.",
  "mechanism": "Acceleration is calculated as the derivative of velocity with respect to time, providing a measure of how rapidly the velocity of an object changes. This allows engineers and designers to create systems that can accelerate objects in a controlled manner, such as cars accelerating from a standstill or planes reaching takeoff speeds."
