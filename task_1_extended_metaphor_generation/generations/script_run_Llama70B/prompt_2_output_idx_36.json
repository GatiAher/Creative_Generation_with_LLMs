  "purpose": "The base pairing's purpose is to create a stable and complementary partnership between two nucleotides, which allows for the formation of a double helix structure that can store and transmit genetic information. This partnership is crucial for the accuracy and integrity of genetic code, ensuring that the correct sequence of nucleotides is maintained and passed on to new cells. From a geometric perspective, the base pairing can be seen as a 'lock and key' system, where each nucleotide has a unique shape that fits perfectly with its complementary partner, creating a secure and precise connection.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of base pairing involves the formation of hydrogen bonds between nucleotides, which creates a strong and specific interaction between them. Adenine pairs with thymine through two hydrogen bonds, while guanine pairs with cytosine through three hydrogen bonds. These bonds are formed due to the unique shape and chemical properties of each nucleotide, which allow them to fit together like puzzle pieces. The double helix structure that forms as a result of these pairings is incredibly stable, allowing it to withstand the forces that would otherwise cause it to break apart or become tangled. Additionally, the specificity of the base pairing ensures that errors in DNA replication are rare, as the incorrect pairing of nucleotides would disrupt the stability of the double helix structure."
