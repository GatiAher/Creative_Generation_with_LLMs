  "purpose": "The purpose of limiting reagents is to control the quantity of products generated in a chemical reaction by constraining the availability of one or more essential reactants. This regulation ensures that the reaction proceeds within desired parameters, preventing overproduction or depletion of resources.",
  "mechanism": "The limiting reagent's structure is designed to dictate its rate of consumption during the chemical reaction. By controlling the concentration, molar ratio, or particle size of the limiting reagent, the reaction's progress is regulated. As the limiting reagent is consumed, it influences the formation of the product, ultimately determining the yield. This carefully balanced system allows for precise control over the outcome, ensuring predictable results."
