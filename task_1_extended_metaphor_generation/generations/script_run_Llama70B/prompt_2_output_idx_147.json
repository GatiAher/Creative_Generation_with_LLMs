  "purpose": "Newton's Second Law provides a fundamental relationship between an object's mass, acceleration, and the force acting upon it, allowing for calculations and predictions of motion, stability, and influence of external forces on an object.",
  "mechanism": "The law is structured around the concept of force (F), which is proportional to both mass (m) and acceleration (a). This means that as the mass of an object increases, the force required to produce a given acceleration also increases. Similarly, as the acceleration of an object increases, the force required to produce that acceleration also increases. This relationship allows engineers, designers, and mathematicians to calculate and predict the motion of objects under various conditions, such as changes in velocity or direction, and to determine the influence of external forces on an object's motion."
