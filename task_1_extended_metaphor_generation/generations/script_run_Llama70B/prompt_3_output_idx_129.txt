Isotopic fractionation enables the study of the movement and transformation of substances across various environmental processes, providing valuable information for understanding Earth's geological history and the impact of natural and human-induced changes on the environment. Isotopic fractionation occurs due to differences in the behavior of different isotopes during physical, chemical, and biological processes. This difference leads to a change in the ratio of isotopes in a substance as it moves through the environment, allowing researchers to track the substance's pathway and transformations.
