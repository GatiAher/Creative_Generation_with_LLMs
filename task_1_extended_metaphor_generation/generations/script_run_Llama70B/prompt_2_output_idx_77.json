  "purpose": "The purpose of Artificial Intelligence is to enable machines to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as recognizing patterns, learning from experience, and making decisions based on context. AI aims to augment human capabilities and enhance problem-solving processes across various domains like geometry, math, engineering, and design.",
  "mechanism": "Artificial Intelligence operates by combining computational power, statistical models, and domain-specific knowledge to create intelligent systems. These systems are designed to analyze data, identify patterns, and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns. In essence, AI leverages mathematical concepts and algorithms to replicate and augment human cognition, enabling machines to learn from data and adapt to new situations."
