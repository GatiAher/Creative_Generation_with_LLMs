  "purpose": "The purpose of Consistency Models is to guarantee that all copies of shared data in a distributed system are identical and up-to-date, even when multiple users or nodes update the data simultaneously, ensuring accuracy and reliability of the system. This is achieved by employing various mathematical theories and algorithms to detect and resolve any inconsistencies that may arise due to concurrent updates, network delays, or node failures.",
  "mechanism": "Consistency Models work by establishing a unified view of truth for the data across all nodes in the system. They use advanced geometric and mathematical concepts such as vector clocks, Merkle trees, and Byzantine Fault Tolerance to track changes and ensure that all nodes agree on the state of the data at all times. These models also incorporate redundancy and error detection techniques to mitigate the effects of failures and ensure that the data remains consistent even under adverse conditions."
