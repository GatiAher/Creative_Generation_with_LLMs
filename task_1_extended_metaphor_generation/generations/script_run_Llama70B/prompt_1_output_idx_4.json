      "name": "Base pairing",
      "definition": "The process by which nucleotides are paired together to form a complementary base pair, with adenine pairing with thymine and guanine pairing with cytosine."

      "name": "DNA structure",
      "definition": "The double helix structure of DNA, composed of two complementary strands of nucleotides that are twisted together."

    {
      "name": "Replication",
      "definition": "The process by which DNA is copied, involving the unwinding of the double helix and the synthesis of new strands."
