 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings for astronomy, chemistry, scientific jargon, geometry, math, engineering, and design-related words, phrases, and adjectives:

"The Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis" {astronomy} "serves to protect the integrity of information in the universe by preventing the retrieval of data that has fallen into a black hole. This ensures that the information is not compromised or altered in any way, maintaining the accuracy and consistency of the universe's information. The hypothesis proposes that the event horizon" {astronomy} "of a black hole acts as an impenetrable barrier, preventing any information that crosses it from being retrieved. This barrier effectively isolates the information within the black hole, protecting it from external influence and preserving its original state. The hypothesis also suggests that any attempt to retrieve information from a black hole would require a violation of physical laws," {physics} "specifically the laws of thermodynamics," {chemistry} "making it impossible to access the information without destroying the black hole itself."

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.
