  "purpose": "The Biome functions as a spatially-defined, self-sustaining system that regulates and mediates the exchange of energy, matter, and life between the environment and the organisms it harbors. Its purpose is to create and maintain a stable, hospitable environment for diverse living things to thrive and interact, ultimately shaping the landscape itself through their collective actions.",
  "mechanism": "The Biome's mechanism involves a complex network of interconnected components, including abiotic factors like temperature, precipitation, topography, and soil quality, which interact with biotic factors such as plant and animal populations, nutrient cycles, and symbiotic relationships. Together, these elements form a dynamic, self-organizing system that adapts and evolves over time through feedback loops and the flow of energy and resources. The Biome's structure is characterized by patterns of patchiness and connectivity, with diverse habitats and microclimates that support a wide range of species and ecological processes. This intricate arrangement enables the Biome to perform its role as a stabilizing force, moderating environmental extremes and fostering biodiversity."
