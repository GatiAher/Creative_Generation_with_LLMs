 {{{Ecosystem services}}} provide a range of essential benefits to humans and other organisms, including {{{air and water purification, soil formation, climate regulation}}}. These services are critical for maintaining public health, supporting economic development, and ensuring environmental sustainability. The mechanism behind ecosystem services involves complex interactions between {{{biotic and abiotic components}}} within an ecosystem. The structure of an ecosystem is organized around the flow of {{{energy and nutrients}}, which supports the growth and diversity of life forms. This structure enables the provision of various ecosystem services, such as {{{pollination, pest control, nutrient cycling}}} that support human well-being and the health of other species.

Surrounded in double curly braces are terms related to Biology, Chemistry, or scientific jargon:

* Air and water purification
* Soil formation
* Climate regulation
* Biotic and abiotic components
* Energy and nutrients
* Pollination
* Pest control
