  "purpose": "Molecular Bonding creates stable aggregations of atoms, which allows for the formation of molecules with unique properties and functions, essential for engineering and design applications.",
  "mechanism": "Molecular Bonding involves the arrangement of atoms in a specific geometry, leveraging mathematical principles such as vector addition and trigonometry, to create a three-dimensional structure that maximizes bond strength and stability. This structure is supported by the sharing or exchange of electrons between atoms, resulting in a robust and rigid framework that can withstand various external forces and stresses."
