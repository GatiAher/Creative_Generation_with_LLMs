  "purpose": "The Arctic Oscillation plays a crucial role in regulating the temperature and air circulation patterns across the Northern Hemisphere. By influencing the strength and position of the Polar Vortex, it helps maintain a stable climate and prevents extreme weather events from occurring.",
  "mechanism": "The Arctic Oscillation is characterized by fluctuations in atmospheric pressure between the Arctic and mid-latitudes. This pressure gradient drives winds that shape the Polar Vortex, which in turn modulates the flow of cold air from the Arctic to the lower latitudes. The oscillation also affects the jet stream, a high-altitude wind current that plays a significant role in steering weather systems across the globe. Through this complex interplay of atmospheric pressures and wind patterns, the Arctic Oscillation ensures that the Polar Vortex remains intact and functional, thereby maintaining a balance in the global climate system."
