  "purpose": "The Atomic Structure provides a framework for understanding the spatial arrangement of atoms within a molecule, allowing us to better comprehend their relationships and interactions. This knowledge is essential for predicting properties and behavior of molecules in various environments, which informs fields like materials science, drug discovery, and environmental science.",
  "mechanism": "The Atomic Structure consists of a set of atomic positions defined by their coordinates in three-dimensional space. These coordinates are usually represented as x, y, and z values. By analyzing these coordinates, we can determine the distances between atoms, their bond angles, and torsion angles. Additionally, the arrangement of atoms within the molecule gives rise to its overall shape and polarity, which further influences its chemical properties and reactivity."
