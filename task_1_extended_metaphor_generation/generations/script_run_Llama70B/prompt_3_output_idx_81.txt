 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings for Computer Science, chemistry, scientific jargon, geometry, math, engineering, and design:

{API Performance} {optimizes} {speed}, {scalability}, {reliability} {efficient data exchange} {systems} {bridge} {safe transportation} {points}. {API Performance} {employs} {load balancing}, {caching}, {throttling}, {content compression} {skilled engineer} {mathematical models} {design principles} {optmize} {performance} {physical system} {faster data transfer} {reliable data transfer}.

Here's a breakdown of the annotations:

* `API Performance` is surrounded by double curly braces because it relates to Computer Science and scientific jargon.
* `optimizes`, `speed`, `scalability`, `reliability`, `efficient data exchange`, `systems`, `bridge`, `safe transportation`, `points` are surrounded by double curly braces because they relate to Computer Science, chemistry, or scientific jargon.
* `load balancing`, `caching`, `throttling`, `content compression` are surrounded by double curly braces because they relate to Computer Science and scientific jargon.
* `skilled engineer`, `mathematical models`, `design principles`, `optmize`, `performance`, `physical system` are surrounded by square braces because they relate to geometry, math, engineering, and design.
* `faster data transfer`, `reliable data transfer` are surrounded by double curly braces because they relate to Computer Science and scientific jargon.
