  "purpose": "The Conservation of Momentum ensures that the total quantity of motion in a closed system remains consistent, providing a fundamental basis for analyzing and predicting the behavior of objects and systems. It allows us to understand and describe how motion is transferred between objects and how it affects their behavior, enabling us to make informed decisions and designs in various fields such as engineering, physics, and mathematics.",
  "mechanism": "The Conservation of Momentum relies on the concept of momentum, which is defined as the product of an object's mass and velocity. Whenever an external force acts on a system, it imparts a change in momentum to the system. To conserve momentum, the system must respond by adjusting its internal motion, ensuring that the total momentum remains unchanged. This means that if an object gains momentum due to an external force, it must be balanced by a corresponding loss of momentum elsewhere in the system. This principle applies to any isolated system, allowing us to analyze and predict the motion of objects within it, and has far-reaching implications in various disciplines such as engineering, design, and mathematics."
