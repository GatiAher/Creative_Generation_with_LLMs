"Chemical Reactions transforms one or more substances into another substance by manipulating their molecular structures, similar to a sculptor reshaping clay. This process allows for the creation of new materials with unique properties, which can be used in various fields such as medicine, technology, and energy. The mechanism of Chemical Reactions involves the arrangement of atoms and molecules in a specific way to create a desired product. It's like solving a puzzle, where the reactants are the pieces that need to fit together perfectly to form the product. The reaction conditions, such as temperature and pressure, act as constraints that help guide the pieces into their correct positions. Through this process, bonds are broken and formed between atoms, creating a new molecule with different properties than its reactants."
