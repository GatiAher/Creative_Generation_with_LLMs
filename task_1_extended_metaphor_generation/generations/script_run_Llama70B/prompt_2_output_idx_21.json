  "purpose": "Gravitomagnetism provides a framework for understanding how moving charges interact with gravitational fields, allowing us to study the behavior of objects under the influence of both gravity and electromagnetism. This is crucial for understanding phenomena such as gravitational waves and their effects on charged particles.",
  "mechanism": "The structure of Gravitomagnetism is based on the idea of a 'gravitational field' that surrounds massive objects, similar to the way a magnetic field surrounds charged particles. This field can be described using mathematical equations that take into account factors such as mass, distance, and velocity. By solving these equations, we can determine the force that acting on a moving charge in the presence of a gravitational field, allowing us to predict the motion of objects in response to both gravitational and electromagnetic forces."
