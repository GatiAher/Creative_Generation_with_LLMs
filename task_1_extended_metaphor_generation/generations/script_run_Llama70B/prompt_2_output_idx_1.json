  "purpose": "Dwarf planets serve as a window into the formation and evolution of our solar system. They provide valuable insights into the processes that shape the early days of planetary development, such as collisions, gravitational interactions, and atmospheric loss. By studying these small, rocky bodies, we can gain a better understanding of how the planets we know today came to be and the potential for life to exist on other worlds.",
  "mechanism": "The dwarf planets' small size and low gravity environment allows them to maintain a highly eccentric orbit, which takes them far beyond the reaches of the solar system. This unique orbital path provides a natural laboratory for testing theories about planetary migration, asteroid belt dynamics, and Kuiper Belt objects. Their slow movement and long orbital periods grant us ample time to study them in detail, while their proximity to the Sun makes them accessible with current technology. The dwarf planets' composition, which often includes frozen volatiles like methane and ammonia, also offers clues about the chemical building blocks available during planetary formation."
