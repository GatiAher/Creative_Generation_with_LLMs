  "purpose": "The API Documentation serves as a blueprint for interacting with the API, providing step-by-step instructions for successful communication between the client and server. It helps ensure that the API is used correctly, efficiently, and safely, much like a set of building plans guarantees a structure's integrity and functionality.",
  "mechanism": "The API Documentation is structured in a hierarchical manner, with endpoints grouped by functional categories, such as 'users' or 'products.' Each endpoint includes detailed information on the requested method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), URL parameters, request body schemas, and response examples. This organization enables developers to quickly locate relevant information and understand how to effectively utilize the API, similar to how a well-organized set of blueprints allows architects and engineers to easily reference necessary details during construction."
