  "purpose": "The Keystone species plays a crucial role in maintaining the stability and integrity of its ecosystem, much like a keystone holds up an archway. By exerting a disproportionate influence on its environment relative to its abundance, the Keystone species helps create and sustain a balanced and functional ecological system.",
  "mechanism": "The Keystone species' unique characteristics and behaviors enable it to act as a linchpin within its ecosystem. Its structural elements - such as physical adaptations or social organization - allow it to modulate the interactions between other species and their environment, creating a harmonious network of relationships that support biodiversity and resilience."
