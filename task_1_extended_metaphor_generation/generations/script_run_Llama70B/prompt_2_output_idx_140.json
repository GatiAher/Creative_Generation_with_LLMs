  "purpose": "Chemical Energy stores energy in chemical bonds between atoms or molecules, allowing for the manipulation and transformation of matter through chemical reactions. This energy can be harnessed and converted into various forms, such as heat, light, or electricity, making it a versatile resource for powering various applications.",
  "mechanism": "The structure of Chemical Energy is based on the arrangement of atoms and molecules in a way that creates a difference in potential energy between the reactants and products of a chemical reaction. When the chemical bonds are broken or formed, the energy stored in these bonds is released or consumed, respectively. The specific arrangement of atoms and molecules determines the magnitude and direction of the energy release, allowing for control over the type and amount of energy produced."
