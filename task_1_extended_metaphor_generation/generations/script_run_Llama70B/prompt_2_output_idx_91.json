  "purpose": "Message Queueing enables efficient communication between various parts of a distributed system, allowing them to operate independently while still exchanging crucial information. It ensures that data is delivered reliably and in order, preventing message loss or duplication, and permits processing when there is capacity available, reducing overloading and optimizing system performance.",
  "mechanism": "Message Queueing operates like a post office. Messages are dropped off at the queue, which acts as a mailbox. When there's space and resources available, the messages are picked up from the front of the line and processed by a worker, similar to a clerk handling letters. This first-in-first-out (FIFO) approach prevents messages from being lost or jumping the queue, maintaining order and fairness. The queue also has a finite size, stopping it from becoming too full and causing delays or losses. Workers continually retrieve messages from the front of the queue until it's empty or there are no more workers available."
