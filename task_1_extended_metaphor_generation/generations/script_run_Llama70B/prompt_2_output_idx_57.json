  "purpose": "Molecular Shapes provides a framework for understanding the spatial arrangement of atoms within molecules, which informs various fields such as drug design, materials science, and nanotechnology. By analyzing the three-dimensional structure of molecules, researchers can identify patterns and relationships between shape and function, enabling the design of new compounds with desired properties.",
  "mechanism": "The mechanism of Molecular Shapes involves studying the bonding and electron density of molecules to determine their three-dimensional structure. This structure is visualized using geometric models, such as spheres, cylinders, and polyhedra, which represent the positions and distances of atoms within the molecule. These models are then used to analyze the shape and symmetry of the molecule, revealing valuable information about its properties and potential applications."
