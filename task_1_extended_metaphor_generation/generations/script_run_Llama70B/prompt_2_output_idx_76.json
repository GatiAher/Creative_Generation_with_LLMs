  "purpose": "Databases act as a centralized repository for storing, managing, and retrieving large amounts of data. They provide a way to organize and structure data in a meaningful way, making it easier to access, manipulate, and analyze. In essence, databases serve as a map or blueprint for navigating and interacting with data.",
  "mechanism": "Databases consist of multiple layers, each serving a specific purpose. The underlying layer is the storage layer, which is responsible for physically storing the data on disk. Above this lies the file system layer, which manages the organization and fragmentation of data across multiple disks. Next is the query processor layer, which interprets and executes requests for data from applications. Finally, there's the interface layer, which provides a common language and set of commands for communicating with the database. This hierarchical structure enables efficient data retrieval and manipulation, much like a well-designed building has a clear floor plan and functional divisions."
