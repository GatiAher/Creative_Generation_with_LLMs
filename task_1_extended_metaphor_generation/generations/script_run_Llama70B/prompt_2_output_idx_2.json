  "purpose": "Asteroids provide a source of raw materials for spacecraft to visit and study, allowing us to better understand the formation and evolution of our solar system. They also serve as potential anchoring points for deep space missions and offer an opportunity for asteroid mining, which could provide valuable resources such as water and precious metals. Furthermore, studying asteroids can help us protect Earth from potentially hazardous asteroid impacts.",
  "mechanism": "The Asteroids are primarily composed of rock and metal, with some containing iron, nickel, and cobalt. They range in size from small boulders to objects hundreds of kilometers across. Some asteroids have irregular shapes, while others are nearly spherical. Many asteroids have their own moons, and some even have multiple moons. The structure of asteroids varies depending on their composition and history, but they generally consist of a solid core surrounded by a loose surface layer called regolith. This regolith is formed through meteorite impacts and other geological processes, providing a fragile crust that can be easily excavated or manipulated. The low gravity environment of asteroids allows them to be easily landed upon and explored by spacecraft, making them ideal platforms for scientific research and potential resource extraction."
