  "purpose": "Comets serve as a delivery system for essential compounds, such as water, organic molecules, and other life-supporting elements, to the planets in the solar system. They also play a crucial role in shaping the trajectories of celestial bodies within the solar system, influencing orbital patterns and contributing to the formation of new celestial bodies.",
  "mechanism": "Comets are composed of ice and rock, with a highly elliptical orbit that takes them from the outer reaches of the solar system towards the sun. As they approach the inner solar system, the comet's ices vaporize, creating a bright tail of gas and dust that can be seen from Earth. This process allows the comet to release its payload of frozen compounds into space, where they can be absorbed by nearby planets or incorporated into new celestial bodies. The comet's orbital path is influenced by gravitational interactions with nearby celestial bodies, allowing it to modify its course and impact the trajectory of other objects in the solar system."
