The Driving Mechanisms {{{Geology}}} are responsible for the movement of tectonic plates, which ultimately shapes the Earth's surface. This movement is driven by convection currents {{{Geology}}} in the mantle, which generate forces that push the plates apart at mid-ocean ridges and pull them together at subduction zones. The plates also move laterally past each other along transform faults. This process is essential for the formation of new oceanic crust, the creation of mountain ranges, and the distribution of earthquakes and volcanoes. The Driving Mechanisms consist of a series of interconnected processes that work together to drive plate movement. At mid-ocean ridges, magma rises from the mantle and solidifies into new oceanic crust, creating a bulge that pushes the plates apart. At subduction zones, one plate is forced beneath another, generating a zone of compression that causes the overlying plate to move forward. Additionally, there are transform faults where plates can move past each other horizontally, allowing for lateral movement. These processes are supported by the geometry {{{Math}}} and math behind plate tectonics, which ensures that the movement of the plates is consistent with the principles of conservation of energy and momentum.
