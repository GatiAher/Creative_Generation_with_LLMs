  "purpose": "The Volcanic arc serves as a pressure release system for the Earth's crust, allowing for the continuous subduction of oceanic plates beneath continental plates, thereby maintaining the balance of tectonic forces and preventing the buildup of stress that could lead to catastrophic earthquakes or volcanic eruptions.",
  "mechanism": "The Volcanic arc is structured as a curved chain of volcanoes that form along the boundary between the oceanic and continental plates. As the oceanic plate sinks into the mantle, it encounters increasing heat and pressure, causing the rocks to melt and rise through the continental plate, producing a chain of volcanoes. The curvature of the arc allows for the efficient release of magma and pressure, ensuring that the subduction process remains stable and controlled."
