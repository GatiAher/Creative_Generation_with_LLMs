  "purpose": "The Microservices Architecture allows for the decomposition of a large, complex system into smaller, more manageable pieces, much like a geometric shape can be broken down into its constituent parts. This enables better scalability, flexibility, and maintainability of the system, similar to how a modular design in engineering enables the building of complex structures from smaller, interconnected components.",
  "mechanism": "The Microservices Architecture is structured as a collection of small, independent services, each designed to perform a specific task. These services communicate with each other using APIs, allowing them to exchange information and work together to achieve a common goal, similar to how different components in a mechanical system work together to achieve a desired function. The services are designed to be loosely coupled, meaning they are not tightly connected to each other and can operate independently, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability. This structure also allows for easier maintenance and replacement of individual services as needed, much like how a modular design in engineering allows for easy replacement of individual components."
