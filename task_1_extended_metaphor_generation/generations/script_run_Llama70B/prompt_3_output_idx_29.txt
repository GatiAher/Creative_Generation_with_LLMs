 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings for biology, chemistry, scientific jargon, geometry, math, engineering, and design:

"The Niche serves as a spatially-defined slot within an ecosystem, allowing for efficient resource allocation and reduction of competition among co-existing species. By occupying a distinct position, a species can exploit available resources while avoiding direct conflict with others, thereby maximizing overall biodiversity and ecological resilience. The Niche operates by defining a set of {{{geometry}}} constraints that specify the allowable interactions between species. This is achieved through the combination of {{{abiotic factors}}}such as temperature, light, and moisture, and {{{biotic factors}}} such as predation, competition, and mutualism. The resulting complex network of relationships structures the ecosystem into a stable, interconnected system, where each species maintains a unique adaptive position."
