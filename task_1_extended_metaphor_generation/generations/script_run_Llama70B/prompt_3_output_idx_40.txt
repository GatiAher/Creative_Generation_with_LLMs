 {{Biology}} The Translation process serves as a blueprint for fabricating fundamental building blocks of life, connecting sequence of nucleotides in mRNA to corresponding amino acid sequences in polypeptide chains. Essentially, it deciphers the genetic code embedded within the RNA molecule and utilizes this information to create precise arrangements of amino acids, thereby giving rise to diverse proteins with unique functions and properties. The Translation process operates via a sequential and coordinated series of steps. Initially, an enzyme known as ribosome recognizes and attaches to the mRNA template. Then, the ribosome reads the sequence of nucleotides in groups of three, referred to as codons. Each codon specifies a particular amino acid or a signal to terminate protein synthesis. As the ribosome encounters each codon, the appropriate amino acids are brought into position and linked together through peptide bonds. This process continues until the entire polypeptide chain is formed or a termination signal is reached. The resulting protein may then undergo further modifications and folding to acquire its final structure and functionality.

[Math] The Translation process can be represented mathematically by a set of rules that define the correspondence between the sequence of nucleotides in mRNA and the sequence of amino acids in polypeptide chains. The rules are based on the genetic code, which is a set of triplets of nucleotides (codons) that specify each amino acid or a termination signal. The ribosome acts as a machine that reads the sequence of codons in the mRNA template and adds amino acids to the growing polypeptide chain according to the specified rules. The result is a precise arrangement of amino acids that gives rise to diverse proteins with unique functions and properties.
