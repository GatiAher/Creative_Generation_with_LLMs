  "purpose": "The Continental Drift's purpose is to distribute landmasses across the earth's surface in a way that maintains balance and stability. This distribution ensures that the earth's lithosphere is evenly stretched and cooled, preventing excessive buildup of heat and pressure that could lead to catastrophic events such as massive earthquakes or volcanic eruptions. Additionally, the movement of continents creates diverse geographical features such as mountains, oceans, and climate zones, supporting the development of various ecosystems and habitats for life on earth.",
  "mechanism": "The Continental Drift operates through a system of interconnected plates that cover the earth's surface. These plates are in constant motion, sliding over a more fluid asthenosphere below. The movement of these plates is driven by convection currents in the earth's mantle, which are powered by heat from the earth's core. As the plates move, they interact with each other at boundaries, sometimes colliding and forming mountain ranges or oceanic trenches, and sometimes pulling apart to create new oceans. The arrangement of these plates and their interactions support the formation of different geological features and influence the global climate, ultimately shaping the earth's surface and its habitability."
