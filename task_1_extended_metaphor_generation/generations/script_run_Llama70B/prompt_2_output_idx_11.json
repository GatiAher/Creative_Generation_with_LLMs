  "purpose": "The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation serves as a remnant of the Big Bang, providing a glimpse into the earliest moments of our universe's existence. Acting as a cosmic fossil, it offers insight into the fundamental laws of physics and the initial conditions that shaped our universe.",
  "mechanism": "The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation is an electromagnetic echo of the Big Bang, with its formidable energy scale and blackbody spectrum serving as evidence of the universe's origins. Its uniformity across the sky and slight fluctuations provide a snapshot of the primeval density distribution, allowing us to infer the evolution and expansion of the universe through time."
