  "purpose": "The Terrestrial Planets serve as habitable environments for life to thrive. They provide stable surfaces for the development of ecosystems, allowing for the evolution of diverse flora and fauna. The planets' solid surfaces also enable the formation of atmospheres, which regulate temperature and protect against harmful radiation. This creates a delicate balance that sustains life.",
  "mechanism": "The Terrestrial Planets are designed with specific geometric and mathematical properties that facilitate their habitability. Their near-circular orbits maintain relatively constant distances from the Sun, ensuring steady temperatures and energy input. The planets' compositions are carefully balanced, incorporating elements that promote the formation of stable crusts, atmospheres, and hydrospheres. The engineering of these planets' structures involves the strategic distribution of mass and density, generating gravitational forces that foster the retention of atmospheric gases and the creation of magnetic fields. These factors synergistically support the emergence and sustenance of life."
