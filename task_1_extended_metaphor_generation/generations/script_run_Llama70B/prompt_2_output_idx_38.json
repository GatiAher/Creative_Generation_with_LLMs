  "purpose": "The Replication process serves to create a duplicate copy of a genetic blueprint, ensuring the integrity and continuity of inheritable traits and characteristics. This process is crucial for the perpetuation of life, as it allows organisms to reproduce and pass on their genetic information to offspring.",
  "mechanism": "The Replication process consists of two main stages: unwinding and synthesis. Unwinding involves the separation of the double helix into two complementary strands, while synthesis entails the creation of new strands by matching nucleotides to the template strands. This process takes place within a specifically designed molecular environment, where enzymes called helicases and primases facilitate the unwinding and synthesis reactions. The resulting copies are then checked for accuracy and sealed to prevent any further alterations, ensuring an exact replica of the original genetic material."
