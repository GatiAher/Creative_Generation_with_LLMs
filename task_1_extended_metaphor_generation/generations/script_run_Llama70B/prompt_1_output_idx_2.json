    {
      "name": "Black Hole",
      "definition": "A region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape."
    },
    {
      "name": "Event Horizon",
      "definition": "The point of no return around a black hole, beyond which anything that enters cannot escape."
    },
    {
      "name": "Gravitational Lensing",
      "definition": "The bending of light around a massive object, such as a star or black hole, due to its gravitational field."
    },
    {
      "name": "Frame Dragging",
      "definition": "The effect where the rotation of a rotating body causes the fabric of spacetime around it to rotate along with it."
    },
    {
      "name": "Gravitomagnetism",
      "definition": "The gravitational analogue of magnetism, which describes the interaction between gravitational fields and moving charges."
    },
    {
      "name": "Cosmic Censorship Hypothesis",
      "definition": "The idea that any information that falls into a black hole is lost forever, and that the event horizon acts as a boundary beyond which information cannot be retrieved."
    },
    {
      "name": "Holographic Principle",
      "definition": "The idea that the information contained in a region of spacetime can be encoded on the surface of that region, known as the holographic principle."
