  "purpose": "The Planets serve as massive gravitational anchors, stabilizing the overall architecture of the Solar System and enabling the formation of habitable zones for life to thrive. They also provide a foundation for astronomical unitary operations, such as navigation and timekeeping.",
  "mechanism": "The Planets are composed of densely packed rock, metal, and ice, generating immense gravitational forces that bind them into predictable orbital paths around the Sun. Their varied sizes, masses, and surface conditions create diverse environments conducive to planetary differentiation, atmosphere retention, and potential habitability. The Planets' harmonious arrangement and movements enable the creation of spatial reference frames, facilitating astronomical calculations, predictions, and explorations."
