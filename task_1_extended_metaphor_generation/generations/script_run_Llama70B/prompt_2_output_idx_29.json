  "purpose": "The Niche serves as a spatially-defined slot within an ecosystem, allowing for efficient resource allocation and reduction of competition among co-existing species. By occupying a distinct position, a species can exploit available resources while avoiding direct conflict with others, thereby maximizing overall biodiversity and ecological resilience.",
  "mechanism": "The Niche operates by defining a set of geometric constraints that specify the allowable interactions between species. This is achieved through the combination of abiotic factors such as temperature, light, and moisture, and biotic factors such as predation, competition, and mutualism. The resulting complex network of relationships structures the ecosystem into a stable, interconnected system, where each species maintains a unique adaptive position."
