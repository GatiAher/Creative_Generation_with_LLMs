  "purpose": "Newton's First Law provides a fundamental principle for understanding how objects move and respond to forces. It helps us understand how objects maintain their state of motion, whether they are moving or stationary, and how external forces can change that motion. This law allows us to predict and analyze the behavior of objects in various situations, such as when a force is applied, when an object collides with another, or when an object is subjected to a changing environment.",
  "mechanism": "The law is structured around the concept of inertia, which refers to an object's tendency to resist changes in its motion. The law states that an object will maintain its state of motion unless it is compelled to change that motion by an external force. This means that if there is no net force acting on an object, it will continue to move in a straight line at a constant speed. The law also applies to systems of objects, where the sum of the forces acting on each object determines the overall motion of the system. By understanding how forces affect the motion of objects, we can design and engineer systems that can efficiently achieve desired outcomes, such as transporting people or goods, lifting heavy loads, or navigating through complex environments."
