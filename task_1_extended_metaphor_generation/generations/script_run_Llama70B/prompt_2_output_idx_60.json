  "purpose": "Acids and Bases play a crucial role in various chemical reactions, facilitating the transfer of electrons between molecules. They help neutralize each other's effects, creating a balanced environment for chemical processes to occur.",
  "mechanism": "Acids are substances that donate electrons easily, while bases accept them readily. This complementary behavior allows them to combine and form salts, which are stable compounds with desirable properties. The geometric shape and electronic configuration of acidic and basic molecules contribute to their functionality. For instance, acids often have a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative element like oxygen or nitrogen, making it easy for the hydrogen atom to dissociate and release a proton. Similarly, bases tend to have an electron pair available for bonding, allowing them to accept a proton from an acid and forming a salt."
