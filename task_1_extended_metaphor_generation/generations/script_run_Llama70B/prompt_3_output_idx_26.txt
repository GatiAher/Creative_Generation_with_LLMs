 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings for biology, chemistry, scientific jargon, geometry, math, engineering, and design:

"{Biosphere} serves as a self-sustaining life support system that regulates and maintains the conditions necessary for {life} to flourish on Earth. It encompasses various interconnected {ecosystems}, which provide essential services such as {air} and {water} purification, {soil} formation, and {climate} regulation. These processes are crucial for supporting life, from the smallest {microorganisms} to complex organisms like {plants} and {animals}. The Biosphere operates through a complex network of interactions and feedback loops, where living organisms interact with their environment and influence the physical world around them. This intricate system is structured into layers, with each layer playing a unique role in sustaining life. For instance, the {atmosphere} regulates temperature and shields against harmful radiation, while the {hydrosphere} manages water distribution and influences weather patterns. The {lithosphere} provides the foundation for landforms and geological processes, and the {pedosphere} enables soil formation and nutrient cycling. The biosphere's architecture allows it to adapt and evolve over time, ensuring the continued diversity and resilience of life on Earth."
