  "purpose": "The Habitat serves as a geometric framework that facilitates the coexistence and interaction of diverse organisms within a delimited space, creating a synergy that promotes biodiversity and sustains life. It provides a complex network of resources, energy pathways, and environmental gradients that enable organisms to adapt, evolve, and thrive.",
  "mechanism": "The Habitat's mechanism is based on the principles of spatial organization, where different components are arranged in a way that maximizes their interactions and relationships. This structure is designed to optimize the use of resources, minimize competition, and foster mutualistic relationships. The Habitat's layout also allows for the creation of microclimates and niches, providing a variety of environments that support a wide range of organisms and their unique needs. Additionally, the Habitat's boundaries act as a containment system, regulating the flow of matter and energy between the habitat and its surroundings."
