 Here's the annotated text with the requested surroundings:

"The API Gateway acts as a guardian for the API, ensuring that only authorized and appropriate requests are allowed to pass through to the server. It serves as a shield, protecting the server from malicious or excessive requests, and providing a layer of security and control. The API Gateway is designed like a multi-layered pyramid, with each layer serving a specific function. The first layer is responsible for {Authentications} , verifying the identity of incoming requests and ensuring that they come from trusted sources. The second layer performs {Rate Limiting}, controlling the frequency of requests to prevent overload and abuse. Finally, the third layer terminates {SSL} connections, encrypting data and protecting it from eavesdropping and tampering. This hierarchical structure allows the API Gateway to efficiently manage and monitor traffic, ensuring that only legitimate requests reach the server."

I have surrounded words related to Computer Science, chemistry, and scientific jargon in double curly braces, and words related to geometry, math, engineering, and design in square braces.
