  "purpose": "Gravitons are hypothetical particles that aim to mediate the force of gravity, which means they help explain how objects with mass attract each other at a distance. In essence, they are responsible for transmitting the force that keeps planets in orbit around their stars and causes objects to fall towards the ground.",
  "mechanism": "The structure of Gravitons is thought to be a tiny, vibrating string that exists in a higher-dimensional space-time. These vibrations give rise to the gravitational force, which acts between particles with mass or energy. The vibrations also create a field that permeates all of space, allowing Gravitons to interact with other particles and transmit the force of gravity across vast distances."
