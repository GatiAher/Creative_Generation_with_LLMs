Orthonormal bases, a structured array, 
Like grid-based movements, in games they play. 
Orthogonal vectors, set in right angles strong, 
Coherently guiding transformations along. 

In SVD and gaming, order is key, 
Efficiently expressing complexity, you see. 
Structured arrangements, meticulously made, 
For elegant representation to cascade. 

Just as in math, with vectors aligned, 
In games and matrices, coherence defined. 
Orthonormal bases and grid movement's grace, 
Both rely on structure in their place.
