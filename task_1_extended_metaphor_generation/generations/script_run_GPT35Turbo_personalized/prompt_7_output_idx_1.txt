Orthonormal bases and kpop choreography,
Both built on precision and symmetry.
Vectors aligned, dancers in formation,
Structured arrangements, creating sensation.

Orthogonality in basis, angles just right,
Choreographed movements, a visual delight.
Coherent patterns, elegant display,
Complex transformations, in a structured way.
