In writing a story, just like math's base,
Orthonormality in both finds its place.
Vectors set orthogonal, patterns in line,
Structuring core operations, design so fine.

Plot development, like SVD's grace,
Structured arrangement in characters' embrace.
Elements crafted align, progression clear,
Enhancing narrative, impact sincere.
