  "purpose": "Orthonormal Bases act as the artistic palette within the realm of singular value decomposition, providing a harmonious and essential foundation for expressing complex transformations and decompositions in a well-balanced and orthogonal manner.",
  "mechanism": "These bases are meticulously designed as a set of vectors that are meticulously crafted to be at right angles to each other, forming a coherent and standard unit of measure. This structured arrangement allows for the elegant representation and deconstruction of intricate patterns and relationships within the artistic framework of singular value decomposition."
