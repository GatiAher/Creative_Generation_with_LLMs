Singular Value Decomposition can be likened to a Pokemon game where the goal is to capture and train powerful creatures known as Singular Values. 

Just like in the game, the orthonormal bases act as the trainers who guide and nurture the Singular Values, helping them reach their full potential. These bases provide a solid foundation for the Singular Values to grow and evolve, much like how trainers help their Pokemon learn new moves and abilities.

As you progress through the game, you will encounter different challenges and obstacles that test the strengths and abilities of your Singular Values. By utilizing the orthonormal bases effectively, you can overcome these challenges and continue to improve the overall performance of your team.

Ultimately, the goal of the game is to become the master of Singular Value Decomposition, harnessing the power of the Singular Values and their orthonormal bases to solve complex problems and achieve success in your data analysis tasks. Just like in a Pokemon game, the key to success lies in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of your team, and utilizing them strategically to achieve your goals.
