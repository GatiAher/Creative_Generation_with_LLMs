Singular value decomposition can be likened to writing a short story, where orthonormal bases represent the setting and characters of the story. Just as a writer carefully crafts their characters and setting to create a compelling narrative, in SVD, the orthonormal bases serve as the foundation upon which the decomposition is built.

The singular values in SVD can be compared to the plot twists and key moments in a short story. Just as a well-placed plot twist can completely change the direction of a story, the singular values in SVD provide crucial information about the data and reveal hidden patterns or relationships that may not be immediately apparent.

Overall, just as a well-crafted short story captivates the reader and leaves a lasting impression, a well-executed singular value decomposition can uncover valuable insights and enhance the understanding of complex datasets. Both processes require careful attention to detail and a thoughtful approach to create a meaningful and impactful result.
