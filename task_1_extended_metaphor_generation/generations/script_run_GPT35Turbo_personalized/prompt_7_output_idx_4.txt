Singular values and themes alike,
In decomposition and stories they strike.
Hierarchy and importance they bestow,
Clearing clutter, letting essential elements glow.

Simplification is their shared game,
Breaking down complexity, making things tame.
Interpretable components, core themes they find,
Guiding us through the cluttered mind.

Harmonious composition they bring,
Balancing forms, ensuring a smooth ring.
In data and narratives, they both blend,
Creating coherence, from start to end.
