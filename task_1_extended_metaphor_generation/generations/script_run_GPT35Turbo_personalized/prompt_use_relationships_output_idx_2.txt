Singular value decomposition is like video game design in the way that Orthonormal Bases are like Grid-based movement mechanics. Just as Orthonormal Bases are carefully constructed sets of vectors with orthogonality, providing a standard unit of measure for elegant representation and deconstruction of patterns, Grid-based movement mechanics in video games rely on orthogonal grids for coherent movement systems, enabling precise positioning and navigation within the game world.

Similarly, the relationship between Singular Values and User Interface (UI) Design involves elements like Hierarchy and Importance. While Singular Values establish a sense of hierarchy and importance to essential elements for clarity and focus, UI Design in video games structures the layout and visibility of crucial game elements in a hierarchy to guide the player's attention. Both Singular Values and UI Design also emphasize Simplification by breaking down complex structures into simpler, more meaningful components and providing a visually appealing and cohesive layout through Harmonious Composition, ensuring coherence, balance, and immersion.
