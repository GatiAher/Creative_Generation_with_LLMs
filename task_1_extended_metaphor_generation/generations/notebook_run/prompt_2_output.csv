The Sun's design as a massive ball of hot plasma generates energy through nuclear fusion, which maintains its internal pressure and heat, allowing it to emit light and heat essential for sustaining life on Earth.","The Sun serves as the gravitational anchor that holds the solar system together, providing the necessary force to keep planets in stable orbits.
