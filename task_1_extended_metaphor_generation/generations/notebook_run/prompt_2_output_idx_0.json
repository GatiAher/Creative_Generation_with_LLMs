  "purpose": "The Sun serves as the gravitational anchor that holds the solar system together, providing the necessary force to keep planets in stable orbits.",
  "mechanism": "The Sun's massive size and gravitational pull create a central point of attraction, around which planets move in elliptical orbits according to Kepler's laws of planetary motion. The Sun's design as a massive ball of hot plasma generates energy through nuclear fusion, which maintains its internal pressure and heat, allowing it to emit light and heat essential for sustaining life on Earth."
