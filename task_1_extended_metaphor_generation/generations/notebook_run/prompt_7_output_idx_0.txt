Just like the Sun in the celestial ballet,
Kpop idols too have a gravitational sway.
An anchor, a force, pulling fans near,
Creating orbits of fame, so clear.

Elliptical paths both entities tread,
Guided by forces, their journeys are led.
The Sun's pull on planets, a familiar dance,
Idols' fame revolves in a similar trance.

Thermodynamics at play, energy aglow,
The Sun's fusion lights up its show.
Likewise, idol status, talent ablaze,
Radiating energy in captivating ways.

Sustainability, a key for both to last,
The Sun's light, for life's cast.
Idols' influence, a vital beam,
Creating a space where dreams can gleam.
