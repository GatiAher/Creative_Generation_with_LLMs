Write an analogy for how ${subtensor_name} in ${tensor_name} is similar in mechanism and function to ${subvehicle_name} in ${target_domain}. Both ${subtensor_name} in ${tensor_name} and ${subvehicle_name} in ${target_domain} have the following characteristics in common:

Spec:```
${schema}
```

Desired format of output: json list of objects.
```
[{
	metaphor: both ${subtensor_name} in ${tensor_name} and ${subvehicle_name} in ${target_domain} have {description of design principle and mechanism in spec}
	${subtensor_name_as_json_key}: describe the purpose and mechanism utilized by the design principle in cell membrane
	${subvehicle_name_as_json_key}: explain how the purpose and mechanism utilized by the concept of "Fan Clubs" in Kpop mirrors that used in the cell_membrane above
},
