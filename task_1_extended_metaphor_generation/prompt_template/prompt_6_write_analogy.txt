Write an extended metaphor for how ${subtensor_name} in ${tensor_name} is similar in mechanism and function to ${subvehicle_name} in ${target_domain}. Both ${subtensor_name} in ${tensor_name} and ${subvehicle_name} in ${target_domain} have the following characteristics in common:

Spec:```
${schema}
```

Desired format of output: json list of objects.
```
{
	"extended_metaphor": [
		{
			"metaphor": both ${subtensor_name} in ${tensor_name} and ${subvehicle_name} in ${target_domain} have {description of first design principle and mechanism in spec}
			"${subtensor_name_as_json_key}": describe the purpose and mechanism utilized by the design principle in ${subtensor_name}
			"${subvehicle_name_as_json_key}": explain how the purpose and mechanism utilized by ${subvehicle_name} in ${target_domain} mirrors that used in the ${subtensor_name} above
		},
		...
